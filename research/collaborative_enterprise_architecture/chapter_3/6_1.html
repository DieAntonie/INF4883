            Let’s chalk out a rough sketch of the strategic planning process in an enterprise. It begins with the strategy formulation, wherein business units within the enterprise engage in preparing their business plans. They derive their business strategy based on the CEO’s mandate and the implied business maxims. Then they identify the business initiatives they will undertake and prepare a time-bound business plan to implement their strategy. Earlier in EA-1, “Defining IT Strategy”, we had a cursory look at how this happens in a car manufacturer example, Car4Us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Figure 3-16 depicts an illustrative portfolio planning process. One of the primary inputs to this process is the collection of business plans coming from all business units. Each business plan identifies the gaps in the enterprise’s IT landscape that need to be bridged for the respective business unit so that it can meet its business objectives. These gaps can broadly be classified as functional gaps and technology gaps. The functional gaps are translated into business needs. The technology gaps are translated into IT needs. These business and IT needs form the basis for identifying and defining IT initiatives or projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this stage, the needs are stated at high level only, sufficient enough to scope the IT initiatives and gauge the order of magnitude for each initiative. This helps arrive at a ballpark cost estimate for each initiative. Evidently this exercise calls for deep insight into the enterprise that only the experienced program managers and seasoned architects there can bring to the table. For that reason, the Portfolio Steering Committee at Bank4Us is composed of Dave Callaghan, the CIO as the chairperson, and senior program managers. Chief architect Oscar Salgado is invited along as a member as well.

            In general, enterprise architects are not accountable for portfolio planning. It is the business units that drive the CIO’s agenda. Nevertheless, enterprise architects play an important part in it. Acting as an assessor or an advisor, enterprise architects are well positioned and fully equipped to perform the following activities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identifying and consolidating common IT needs across the business units
            </li>
            <li>
                Seeking opportunities to introduce IT-focused initiatives into the portfolio
            </li>
            <li>
                Prioritizing projects based on benefit potential, architectural fit, and implementation risks
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With day-to-day exposure to the activities in EA-1 through EA-8, enterprise architects know what the enterprise does, how it works, and how it behaves. This insight can make them influential personalities in the portfolio planning process. In Bank4Us, Oscar, the chief architect, is a member of the Portfolio Steering Committee for the very same role—as an advisor and as an assessor.
