            <h2>The Gartner Grid</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Gartner Research has elaborated another methodology for formulating IT strategies in a series of papers published during the years 2002 and 2003. The definition of strategy in these papers is very concise (Mack and Frey, 2002):
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                A strategy takes a vision or objective and bounds the options for attaining it.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach to “bounding the options” actually is spelling out abstract decision rules and therefore is yet another instance of management by maxims. The most often cited concept from Gartner’s papers is the two-dimensional grid shown in Table 3-2. This grid can be used to check the completeness of IT strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            On one hand, this grid ensures that all aspects of the IT strategy that may require a decision further down the road are guided by rules. On the other, it lists all inputs from the business strategy that can have an impact on IT and therefore must not be neglected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The seven inputs from the business strategy are spelled out as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Geographic.</strong> This is about the expansion and national/international distribution of the enterprise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Governance.</strong> Who makes decisions, and how are they made? Are the business units or geographic regions relatively autonomous, or is there a strong central authority?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Future.</strong> This concerns how far the time horizon of business plans is. They can be long-term, midterm, or even bound only to what has to be done next.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legacy IT.</strong> Is there a will to make drastic changes, or is the attitude conservative and committed to the current way of operation?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Virtual.</strong> This is about the involvement and integration of service providers and other partners. What capabilities and processes are kept in-house, and which are handed over to partners?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer.</strong> How strongly does the enterprise want to engage its customers?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Funding.</strong> Who is paying and how much? How are projects funded, and what are the criteria for granting budgets?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These inputs must be taken into account, according to Gartner. If they are not available right away, the enterprise architect must seek answers and hold the business side accountable for giving them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The business imperatives are then mapped to five components of the IT strategy, which can briefly be explained as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Infrastructure.</strong> This is the technology component, comprised of hardware, software, and network elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Service.</strong> This concerns the services provided by the IT department to the enterprise, to partners, and to customers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Applications.</strong> This is about the portfolio of applications, their business functions, and the processes and organizations it supports.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integration.</strong> All means making the enterprise act as a single unit are subsumed under this component.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sourcing.</strong> This component addresses the source of all the people who perform the IT-related strategic work. In particular it sets rules for selecting internal employees or external service providers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now, how can we use the Gartner grid in practice? Let’s take the example of an automotive supplier and the goal we discussed earlier:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                We must be able to ramp up a plant in half a year in any geographic region, and we want to reach this capability in one year.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            This requirement can be seen as one of the inputs in Gartner’s Geographic row. But what does it imply for the different columns of the IT strategy? Here is a walk-through that should sketch the idea:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Infrastructure.</strong> The IT organization decides to go for highly standardized technology stacks that can rapidly be replicated to new sites. The rule is to prefer out-of-the-box solutions over custom implementations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Service.</strong> The guideline is to rely as much as possible on onsite services but to work according to the standards established in other parts of the world. Services are to be provided in the local language.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Applications.</strong> The principle is to utilize the standard applications and global templates of business processes. Customization must be justified by strong reasons—for instance, country-specific legal constraints.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integration.</strong> The integration is to be kept to a minimum. Integration costs grow over-proportionally with the number of sites, and a tight integration can slow the implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sourcing.</strong> The work is done by onsite forces. External suppliers are preferred in order to keep latencies for training and education at a minimum.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In practice, the mapping rarely is straightforward and without logical conflicts. A good governance of strategic planning should not leave the IT side alone with business requirements that are impossible to accomplish. Instead, there must be feedback loops allowing for a reconsideration or reprioritization of business maxims.
