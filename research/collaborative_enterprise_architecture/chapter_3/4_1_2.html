            <h2>Building the competence</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            When organizations take a strategic view on the career progression of their IT staff, they tend to spend more money training them. The training may be facilitated through external training institutes or channelized through online media. However, beyond a certain point, only experience (and not knowledge) counts. You can acquire the tacit knowledge needed for higher proficiency levels only through your own experience and, to some extent, by learning from the lessons of experienced people in the field. Job rotation is a good tool to get adequate exposure and experience in the field of aspiration. In addition, the enterprise architect should join a community of practice in her interest area.
        </p>
        <p>
            A rather easy way of job rotation is for architects to spot business analysts and technical developers who would make good architects. These professionals’ intrinsic talent can be sensed by looking at the kind of questions they ask about their projects. For instance, are they curious to know how their solution is going to be used by the business? What benefit it is going to deliver? How is their project linked to other projects? This constant analysis helps elevate or change their roles to make the best use of available (and rather scarce) talent as well as to offer them better exposure to be a good architect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way of job rotation, especially for practicing architects, is to switch position between strategic activities to operational activities at regular intervals (maybe quarterly or semiannually). The balance of strategic and operational experience must be a prerequisite for promotion to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also a best practice, if it is possible, to recruit or depute people from the business side to the IT side, and vice versa. This applies especially to businesspeople with project or program management backgrounds. They can be more easily groomed to acquire technology management expertise. In addition, they bring their business acumen and experience to the IT crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar manner, IT personnel with reasonable business understanding can be deputed into business — as apprentices and ambassadors, especially engaging them in the activities related to process modeling, process analysis, data analysis, business executive training, and so forth. Enterprise architects need to have complete and rounded personalities to be successful. This can only happen if their career progression spans strategy and operation and across business and IT.

            Although learning by experience is the best way, it is a rather long process. Learning from others is a reasonable approach, too. There are many ways to facilitate this type of learning. A community of practice consists of a group of people bound together by shared expertise and a passion for a joint mission, working together to foster and develop knowledge. It provides a sense of belonging to the individuals working on different projects and a platform for sharing and developing common competencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Evidently, a community of practice requires an economy of scale in terms of opportunities and demands for it in order to become a viable, sustainable, and successful venture. In essence, it is meant to fulfill needs in a specific competency area by proactive provisioning of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A skilled and trained workforce
            </li>
            <li>
                Strong partner relations
            </li>
            <li>
                Tested and proven technical solutions and development methodologies
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will look into new avenues of fostering a community culture in the organization in Chapter 8, “Inviting to Participation.”
