            <h2>Prioritizing the projects</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Looking back at Figure 3-13, you find many IT initiatives being identified to fulfill the IT needs of business units. These initiatives need to be prioritized, shortlisted, and then budgeted as projects for execution. To prioritize them, three things are needed: a list of initiatives, the criteria for prioritization, and most important, the right set of people to participate in the prioritization process.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step in the prioritization process is to define what constitutes a project and to enforce this definition so that the projects can be compared on equal footing. This can be done easily by mandating a standardized statement of work or project charter template.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step is to provide a consistent framework for prioritization. It must allow assessing all projects with an impartial eye. It should be based on predefined criteria, such as value contribution, strategic fit, implementation risks, cost, and so forth. The criteria depend on the enterprise and its market outlook, business priorities, and organizational constraints. Yet generic prioritization criteria are worth mentioning: They may act as a springboard to establish a tailor-made prioritization scheme for a specific enterprise. The parameters are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Value contribution.</strong> This parameter expresses the business value the project aims to deliver. Is it meant to reduce expenses, increase revenue, contribute to competitiveness of the company, or serve regulatory compliance? Is the benefit quantifiable?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategic fit.</strong> This parameter recognizes if the project is taking the enterprise in the strategic direction. Is this project serving the strategic intent of the enterprise, whatever that may be—for instance, be a first mover, be an early follower, enhance brand value, or improve market penetration?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cross-LOB ranking.</strong> This criterion looks at the cross-organizational impact of the project. Who is the sponsoring business unit, and how relevant is this project for other business units and to the enterprise as a whole?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Implementation risks.</strong> This value measures the deployment feasibility, ease of implementation, or probability of success. Is the enterprise really capable of executing this project?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integration complexity.</strong> This parameter assesses the level of interdependencies and integration requirements stemming from this project. How well are the upstream and downstream dependencies in the project managed? How easy it is to seamlessly integrate the project implementation into the enterprise’s IT landscape?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cost.</strong> This criterion gauges whether the cost estimates are in the permissible range for business acceptance and in line with the anticipated value contribution of the project. Are the costs justifiable and within sound limits?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These criteria are to some extent interrelated. For instance, high-value projects are normally big; they bear high costs and high risks. As a consequence, the entry barrier for high-value projects is also quite high. One such big project causes more damage when it fails than 10 small ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The criteria we’ve outlined are generic and can be further extended or drilled down as needed. However, most of the criteria are not really quantifiable and cannot be objectively assessed. At best, one can do the rating on a scale of 1 to 10. As a result, the prioritization process requires tacit knowledge of the enterprise. The steering committee, comprising program managers and chaired by the CIO, typically brings that knowledge to the table. The same steering committee also serves as the decision authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third step is the prioritization process itself. The steering committee prioritizes the projects under the known organizational constraints such as available funds, sourcing capacity, project inter-dependencies, and so forth. The process involves a what-if analysis on multiple portfolio scenarios, adjustment to parameters and constraints in the portfolio, and simulating and assessing alternatives. The goal is to determine the optimal allocation of investments to initiatives and projects. It follows pretty much the same approach that is employed in financial portfolio analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            The output of the prioritization process, among other things, comprises:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                An investment matrix that shows which programs get investments (along the rows) and from which source (along the columns)
            </li>
            <li>
                An integrated release plan that shows broad timelines for the IT initiatives, with critical interdependencies and constraints highlighted
            </li>
            <li>
                A feedback loop into the business units
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The project prioritization does not have a closed-form solution. It is a constrained optimization process that involves many parameters and is fairly complex. As the size of a portfolio grows, prioritization gets overwhelmingly complex, and a simple spreadsheet-based assessment becomes futile. Beyond this point, the use of a more sophisticated portfolio management tool does make sense. Taking a deep dive into the portfolio analysis process is beyond the scope of this book. Interested readers can refer to the literature available on the subject of IT portfolio management.
