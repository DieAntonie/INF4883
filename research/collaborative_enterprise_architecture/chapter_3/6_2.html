            Once the projects have been planned and funded, they move into delivery mode. The project teams are formed and the work begins. The focus is to deliver software features in accordance with the defined scope, specifications, and timeline. Formal management control is in place to ensure that the project delivers what has been committed to.

            While the short-term goals of the business are being met by the projects, enterprise architects need to guard the enterprise IT landscape. They have to ensure that solutions are designed and implemented in view of the long-term goals of the enterprise and in alignment with the envisaged target state. Although enterprise architects should not be involved too deeply in the day-to-day project execution, they need to keep an eye on the projects, especially during design, acceptance, and deployment phases.

            In more mature EA organization, this is done by a formalized portfolio governance. The role of portfolio governance is to provide a decision-making framework that is logical, robust, and repeatable to govern project investments. Figure 3-17 depicts an enterprise architect’s viewpoint on portfolio governance. It typically comprises two formal review processes: an architecture conformance review and a post-implementation review.

            These processes act as tollgates for every project delivery that enters the enterprise’s IT landscape. Ross (2005) identifies the post-implementation review as one of the essential management practices for mature EA organizations. In the next section we will go through the architecture conformance and post-implementation reviews.
