            <h2>Assessing applications</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The agreement on the KPIs prepares the groundwork for assessing the applications in the application catalogue. The goal is to come up with a table like the one shown in Table 3-4.
        </p>
        <p>
            an picks a common scheme invented by Ward and Peppard (2003) to visualize the score of applications in four different quadrants, as shown in Figure 3-11. This scheme classifies applications into four main categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <strong>Stars</strong> ensure the current and future business of the enterprise. They are already used in important business processes and primarily support innovative products or services the company backs on as key differentiators in comparison to their competitors. Their importance for the future business is expected to grow. Furthermore, they fit well into the technology roadmap.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Wild Cats</strong>, sometimes also called Question Marks, have a certain potential for future business but do not contribute much to the current business operations. In a sense, these are prototypes that still have to prove their usefulness. They typically explore how new technologies can help seize new business opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Cash Cows</strong> form the operational backbone of the current business. They ensure today’s core operations and generate the largest share of business from IT. Any outage of such a system is a pain and is likely to end up on the CIO’s desk. But a cash cow does not fit nicely into the envisioned future operations and is technology-wise considered “legacy.”
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Poor Dogs</strong> are not important, neither today nor in the future. In some cases they are just residues, the quick wins for an application rationalization initiative. In other cases they are support systems that are somehow needed but do not make a crucial difference to the enterprise. A typical example is an application for tracking working hours.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These four categories have different key quality requirements and therefore must be treated in different ways, as Figure 3-12 13 indicates.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is worth highlighting that EA must show different attitudes to the four quadrants as well: Enterprise architects should not impede the capturing of crucial new ground for Stars and Wild Cats by restrictive quality gates or standardization and integration requirements. Viable applications typically run through a transition from Wild Cats over Stars to Cash Cows, and EA should foster their maturing with smoothly increasing quality constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another aspect worth noting is that the different categories of applications might claim for different approaches in software development, too. Wild Cats and Stars benefit most from agile software development because of its focus on bringing new features to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cash Cows, on the other hand, are merely maintained and therefore offer no compelling reasons to switch to agile (assuming that this is not the approach the company is most acquainted and proficient with). Furthermore, the upgrade of a central Cash Cow needs extensive nonfunctional tests, requires that users and administrators are trained beforehand, and usually implies the physical rearranging of some core business processes. All this needs planning in advance, which does not fit easily into agile software development, with its functionality scoping on a three-week basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stipulating how the four categories of information systems are to be treated is typically also something achieved in EA-1, “Defining the IT Strategy.” Figure 3-12 is just one typical example of such a stipulation.
