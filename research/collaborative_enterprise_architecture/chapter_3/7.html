            Sometimes the enterprise architect needs to leave her large-scale drawing board and become involved in a project or program in a technical leadership role. There are several possible reasons for such an assignment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A project has been identified as carrying high risk from an EA perspective (a new and unfamiliar technology, a critical business process, a new implementation partner, a project reaching across several business lines, and so forth).
            </li>
            <li>
                Higher management has issued a request for a high-profile “technical watchdog” to supervise a strategically important project with board-level attention.
            </li>
            <li>
                A project has been triggered by the EA organization itself (like the ESB pilot project in our Bank4Us example in activity EA-6); in that case, the EA team will want to micro-manage the solution architecture.
            </li>
            <li>
                An enterprise architect adopts a mentoring role for a junior architect as a personal development measure.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The standard books on EA do not cover this particular aspect of an enterprise architect’s work. Malicious tongues could assume that this is due to EA’s elitist self-conception; however, the more likely explanation is that an enterprise architect in a project or program faces the same challenges as a “normal” project architect. This is certainly true to an extent.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a software architect, one frequently encounters the notion that a good specification or model speaks for itself—just like a religious icon that gives its blessing to the developers all by itself, by the sheer force of wisdom. This, of course, is nonsense. During a project’s development phase, the architect proactively needs to make sure that her design is actually implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two quotes at the beginning of this section describe the tightrope walk for the architect in this situation. On one hand, she needs to keep a certain mental distance from the development team. As a technical leader, the architect needs to look carefully at what the developers make of his specification; she must prevent the developers being carried away by technology enthusiasm or “gold-plating” tendencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the architect has to be deeply involved in the development work herself. Otherwise, she does not know what is going on and, even worse, how suitable her design is. She needs to get his hands dirty; the lean and agile community calls this an all-hands-on-deck mindset (Coplien and Bjornvig, 2010, p. 2). Without this mindset, the developers will mock the architect as a mere PowerPoint jockey who excels in drawing pictures with no relation to reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any project architect needs to master this balance of proximity and distance to the developers. On top of that, an enterprise architect has to meet special challenges, when she assumes a technical leadership position in a project or program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on the project context, the enterprise architect can be perceived as savior, intruder, or wisenheimer from the top floor. She cannot completely avoid that perception, but she can influence it. Her best weapons for overcoming preconceptions are a hands-on mindset, as described, and an open communication style without a know-it-all attitude. “If ‘Communication Is King,’ then clarity and leadership are its humble servants,” writes Mark King (Monson-Haefel, 2009, p. 9).
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge might be harder to handle. There is a natural conflict of interest between a project architect and a member of the EA team. The best and easiest solutions for the project do not always match the “big picture” pursued by EA. This makes the enterprise architect a servant of two masters. Typical conflicts include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use of nonstandard frameworks or libraries, which might save the project a lot of effort but is an unwelcome standard violation from EA point of view
            </li>
            <li>
                Extension of the project scope to accommodate a general EA target—for instance, the provision of service interfaces, which increases the project effort and risk
            </li>
            <li>
                Different time horizons in technical planning—short-term, milestone-oriented project planning versus a long-term strategic EA vision
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The enterprise architect must not overemphasize the global perspective and attempt to build the enterprise’s universal IT solution with a single project. On the other hand, she cannot ignore the big picture, either, and turn a blind eye to development of the larger IT landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no patent answer to these challenges. The enterprise architect must make do with professional experience and common sense. As part of a project architecture group, the enterprise architect is the key person to ensure proper judgment on a number of difficult and subtle design decisions. This ability can be expressed by a number of “distinguish X from Y” issues in the design process. Each of them carries the aforementioned dilemma (project versus EA focus) in its genes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Distinguish nonstandard solutions justified by project needs from sheer technology enthusiasm and flippant design decisions
            </li>
            <li>
                Distinguish investing justified effort into the design phase (for instance, on careful interface design, taking up requirements of surrounding systems such as connectivity and performance), from modeling as an end in itself and death by analysis paralysis
            </li>
            <li>
                Distinguish unavoidable domain complexity (which can only be attenuated by skillful requirements engineering) from solution complexity as an indicator of design soundness (as simple as possible, as complex as needed)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Leading other architects in these decisions and coaching them to judge for themselves are essential parts of the enterprise architect’s activity in such a project. In turn, the enterprise architect can benefit from the deep technical expertise in specific technology areas that project architects and developers will bring to the table. Usually more of a technical generalist herself, the enterprise architect should actively involve herself in technical project issues, such as a performance problem due to thread contention somewhere in the server-side Java code. It is a chance for her to gain new insight into common problems as well as to better understand the risks of certain technologies and design patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            “There is no ‘I’ in architecture,” says Dave Quick (Monson-Haefel, 2009, p. 54). Architects — enterprise architects in particular — need to be team players, share their knowledge, constantly check the quality of their own work, and distinguish factual from personal criticism. A good enterprise architect is not a solo artist—maybe the first violinist but always an orchestra musician.
