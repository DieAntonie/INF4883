            <h2>SOA transformations</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Transformations toward a service-oriented architecture (SOA) belong to the more technically driven changeovers of the IT landscape one frequently encounters today. Some time ago there was a debate about the slogan “SOA is dead,” put into the world by the Burton Group (Manes, 2009). Still, the larger firms we’ve seen over the past few years have kept SOA on their strategic agendas.
        </p>
        <p>
            For good reason, SOA is a very suitable architecture paradigm for designing large software systems. The proposed next-generation replacements, such as Sam Ruby’s Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) (Richardson and Ruby, 2007), did not make it to the enterprise IT agenda. Maybe this is because they are not true replacements of SOA but instead are necessary extensions of a too narrow understanding of “services.” The term service had found a rather one-sided interpretation by the WS-* Web services and the extension to REST 16 and other implementation styles of “service,” which is the core of ROA, WOA, MOA 17 (and so on) just correct this narrow-mindedness.
        </p>
        <p>
            But a truth behind the provocative “SOA is dead” is that SOA certainly is past its peak of inflated expectations. Today it will be difficult to find sponsors and followers for an initiative that turns the whole enterprise IT upside down just for the sake of SOA. If SOA is still on the agenda, it is an architecture standard for changes that are needed for other reasons, but not an end in its own right. For example, the ocean carrier striving for a B2B integration with its logistics partners will probably build a solution in the SOA way. As a side effect, the IT landscape moves closer to SOA in that case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, there are considerable advantages of SOA, regardless of any hype cycles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Business-centric design.</strong> A good SOA design sets the priority on business capabilities and processes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reuse of functionality.</strong> SOA services expose functionality with a potential for wider cross-organizational use. The SOA paradigms of encapsulation, statelessness, and service-level agreements help in utilizing existing assets in many contexts. Furthermore, SOA services have a coarse granularity and thereby avoid the felt-like weave of distributed interactions that made earlier attempts with distributed objects (e.g., CORBA 18 ) fail.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flexibility.</strong> SOA clearly separates control logic from business logic and data: The control logic is incorporated in processes, whereas business logic and data are made available by services. This allows for a flexible mapping between the two parts of the game; ideally, processes can be rearranged without much impact on the services, and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Multichanneling.</strong> SOA also separates the presentation logic from control logic, business logic, and data. This implies that the business processes, functionality, and data are no longer bound to a particular end-user application. You can start a process from your desktop, take the next step with your smartphone, and receive progress reports via Short Message Service (SMS).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Decoupling of functionality and technology.</strong> Business architecture and technologies have different life cycles. The technology-agnostic concepts of SOA introduce a level of abstraction that protects the business functionality from heterogeneity and change in the underlying technical infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stability.</strong> The SOA concept of loose coupling and the corresponding techniques stabilize the IT landscape. Outages and performance fall-offs become locally isolated and no longer drag along contiguous applications.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The business-centric design aligning business processes and services with underlying application functionality makes SOA an ideal ally for EA. Both have business-IT alignment on their primary agenda. “SOA provides a unique chance for the first time in IT history to create artifacts that have enduring value for both, the business as well as the technology side,” write Krafzig, Banke, and Slama (2006). They see SOA as an approach for renovating the IT landscape and SOA governance as a means of enterprise architecture management. But given that the IT landscape consists of vast areas with good old mainframes and other assets far off from service orientation, it should be clear that EA must have a much wider scope.
