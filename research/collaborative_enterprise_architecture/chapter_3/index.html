            <h2>What Enterprise Architects Do: Core Activities of EA</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            In this chapter, we dig deeper into the question of what enterprise architects actually do to manage an enterprise’s architecture. What duties belong to their role and make up their profession? What kinds of activities characterize their daily work, and what are the established best practices to perform those duties?
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of the many facets of EA, any compilation of EA activities will probably be incomplete, but the selection we lay out in this chapter lists the situations we most frequently encounter in both practice and literature. The activities we find most characteristic and prevalent are shown in Table 3-1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The emphasis on activities can be different in each firm; an activity that gets the most attention in one firm might be almost neglected in another. Therefore, we do not make an attempt to prioritize activities by importance or effort involved. Neither are we interested in putting them into a sequential order; this is achieved by frameworks such as the TOGAF TM Architecture Development Method, which we’ll take a look at in the next chapter.

                        EA-2 is about making models for the current and the future states. There is a set of techniques, tools, and standards for modeling.

                        EA-3 is about application rationalization and optimizing application landscapes with respect to certain predefined criteria. Evolving a service or process portfolio and modeling the next release of the various architectures (business, IS, technology) are part of this activity. SOA belongs to this activity as an architectural style aligning business and IT.

                    <td>
                        EA-4 is about maturity assessment and competence development for the EA practice and for the IT department as a whole. This involves assessing the architecture practice and improving it. It also comprises the strategic planning of competences that must be there in the architecture team or IT department in order to work with the future set of products and standards.

                    <td>
                        EA-5 is about monitoring technology and standards, choosing the right ones, communicating them, and applying suitable means to check that standards and guidelines are followed accordingly. Examples of such means are reviews or automated tools (e.g., code sniffers in a build environment).

                    <td>
                        EA-6 is about the enterprise architect’s contribution to the project portfolio management. This comprises pushing through strategic EA projects as project owners, assessing projects with respect to strategic fit and standard compliance, and installing quality gates that projects have to pass. The quality gates also give an input to the backfilling of architecture models with the projects’ deliverables.

                    <td>
                        Enterprise architects are often engaged to lead or coach critical, high-value projects from a technical point of view. Their involvement in such projects goes beyond their usual high-level advise-and-monitor role.

                    <td>Managing Risks Involved in IT</td>
                    <td>
                        EA models allow answering questions about the risks involved in IT. What is the impact on business processes or organizational units of server X going down? Enterprise architects are often involved in planning issues, such as failover or 24/7 scenarios. They are also responsible for security guidelines and have a say on (or even control over) service-level agreements (SLAs).
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Business continuity planning, security, SLA

        <p>
            Instead, the two major goals here are drawing a realistic picture of the kind of work that enterprise architects are entangled in and describing some of the established practices to succeed. But we’ll constrain ourselves here to contemporary best practices, meaning approaches you can find out there in the field or in the relevant publications. They’re not our invention, and in the following sections we describe those practices that are, in our own judgment, most well known and convincing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, Part II of the book (Chapters 6 through 8) is dedicated to improvements of the state of the art. We will frequently refer to EA-1 to EA-8 (as shown in Table 3-1) to assess in which activities the improvements can do some good and how they change the current way of working.
        </p>
        <p>
            But for now we’ll stick to the current practice and hope that the newcomer to the subject gets a tangible view of EA, whereas the old hands may enjoy a quick recap, hopefully learning about one or two items they didn’t know about before.
