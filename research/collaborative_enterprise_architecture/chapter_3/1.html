            <h2>Defining the IT strategy (EA-1)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Half of the activities of EA are strategic by nature. Evolving the IT landscape, for example, entails drawing the future information system landscape, which certainly gives a strategic direction. But EA-1, as we shall see, sets up the principles guiding all subsequent strategic decisions and thus is the root and point of departure for strategy.

            <li>
                Defining the goals to be pursued over the time span covered by the strategy
            </li>
            <li>
                Stipulating the rules that dictate how these goals are to be reached
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifying the initiatives that move the enterprise’s IT toward the goals
            </li>
        </ol>

            In this section, we’ll walk through these steps one by one and explain the challenges and approaches involved in each of them.
