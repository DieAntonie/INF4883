            <h2>EA team position in the organization structure</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            In a typical large organization, an enterprise architecture group or even many enterprise architecture groups may be functioning at different places. Figure 3-14 shows potential places where the enterprise architecture group can possibly reside within the corporate structure of such an organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many industry analysts and academic researchers indicate that the most appropriate place for an EA team is under the corporate strategy or any such senior business leadership team (for example, CFO or COO). In that setup, the EA function is intentionally moved outside the IT organization to ensure its independence from IT and to align it better to the business. This position (shown as position 1 in Figure 3-14) gives EA the clout to raise enterprise architecture issues to the highest levels and make decisions based on the best interests of the entire enterprise. However, in practice EA is rarely positioned this way today.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, we predominantly meet the EA group in the direct reporting line to the CIO of corporate IT, as shown by position 2 in Figure 3-14. Corporate IT is typically the IT organization at the highest level, with its own budget and management control. For our subsequent discussions, especially in our Bank4Us example, we presume the positioning of enterprise architecture group to be this way.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also makes sense to establish an EA group while executing a large, multiyear business transformation program that potentially cuts across multiple business units, product lines, customer segments, or geographic regions of the enterprise. In that case, EA can reside at position 3 in the figure and stays within the purview of that program, with direct reporting to the program director or program management office (PMO).
        </p>
        <p>
            When the enterprise IT landscape is transformed by a number of ongoing programs and projects, the EA group may be located in the realm of the application development organization (shown as position 4 in Figure 3-14). In this case, it tends to become quite IT development-centric.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the enterprise requires extensive focus on the run-the-business scenario and an efficient day-to-day business operation, especially in a shared service mode and with a large IT landscape, enterprise architecture is often found at position 5. In this case, the risk for the EA team is to focus too much on IT implementation issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, if a business unit of the enterprise carries a large IT estate, it may have its own enterprise architecture, as shown by position 6.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, there is no such thing as the single right place for the EA team in the organization structure. In general, the right placement for EA is the position where it can seek a balanced view on business-IT alignment that is neither too strategic nor too tactical, neither too broad nor too deep.
