            Normally, the scope of EA is larger than what enterprise architects can handle. It is too much work for one person to manage and too much work for one centralized group of people to deal with. On one hand, it requires a lot of breadth and depth of knowledge and experience. On the other hand, it needs quite some coordination and collaboration. Moreover, the enterprise will not stand still until the EA team has plotted its course of action; it will continue to operate in its “business as usual” way while the enterprise architects are preparing the course of corrective actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In view of such organizational constraints, the best positioning of EA is probably as a community of practice that operates at three levels:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Core team.</strong> Owns and operates enterprise architecture; small in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Extended team.</strong> Subject matter experts, key contributors, working committees, governing bodies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Community.</strong> Interested parties, project team participants and contributors, users.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The core team comprises full-time resources dedicated to the EA practice. Profiles of core team members should reflect a broad coverage of skills and a diversity of experience and soft skills rather than a deep specialization in specific technologies. Generalists are typically preferred over specialists. A deep familiarity with the business domain and processes is of equal or even higher importance than IT technology mastership. Typically, members of the EA core team should originate, in roughly equal parts, from business and IT departments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The extended team consists of well-respected experts in their respective field of expertise — business or IT. They are typically specialists who are invited into the EA fold by solicitation. The extended team comes into action on an as-needed basis. The members normally engage as part of working committees or governing bodies that are geared toward a specific focus area currently under incubation or investigation by the EA team. This can be, for instance, a working group for digital marketing strategy, customer analytics, information security, anti-money-laundering vigilance, or cloud sourcing, to name just a few examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the CIO (or chief architect) may also appoint an architecture review board (ARB) to manage the review of projects and assess project alignment with the enterprise architecture. In a way, the ARB is an extended team that assesses each proposed project or investment for compliance with EA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The community members are the users and stakeholders of enterprise architecture. The community includes corporate leadership, business leaders, business relationship managers, senior IT executives, and, more important, project teams and business users.
        </p>
        <p>
            With respect to the structure described here, an enterprise architecture practice can be viewed as a core team plus a dynamic virtual team, functioning simultaneously at any given point in time.
