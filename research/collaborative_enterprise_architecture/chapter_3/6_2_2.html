            <h2>Taking a collective view of portfolio performance</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The post-implementation review is a process (see Figure 3-17) by which the steering committee takes a collective view of the portfolio performance at the end of each delivery cycleâ€”typically a 90-day release cycle. In addition to the steering committee, this review may seek participation from other stakeholders, such as business sponsors, program managers, and enterprise architects. Each stakeholder has different concerns and motives to judge the success or failure of a project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the architecture conformance discussed earlier, delivery assurance and organizational readiness are the other two predominant management concerns in the post-implementation review (Table 3-13).

        <p>
            The essence of post-implementation reviews is that the performance and outcome of all the projects are viewed in comparison with each other, not in isolation. This allows to assess the overall portfolio performance more often (for instance, once every quarter). A consolidated performance dashboard reported at the portfolio level on a quarterly basis is a powerful management tool. It offers a number of strategic levers to the CIO, supporting the following activities:

                Adjusting the priorities and investments rapidly in response to the business flux
            </li>
            <li>
                Balancing the project pressure and change impact among different departments
            </li>
            <li>
                Assessing the strategic value of projects that have a seemingly low ROI
            </li>
            <li>
                Providing feedback on strategic decisions back to the business more frequently
            </li>
        </ul>
