            <h2>Competence development for enterprise architects</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            In the first century BC, Marcus Vitruvius Pollio 20 described an ideal architect as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                A man of letters, a skilled draftsman, a mathematician, familiar with historical studies, a diligent of philosophy, acquainted with music, not ignorant of medicine, earned in the responses of juris consultis, familiar with astronomy and astronomical calculations.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Today the image of an enterprise architect in IT continues to be loyal to this 2,000-year-old definition — in the sense that an enterprise architect in today’s information age is perceived as a multidimensional personality. She knows a lot of things and can do many things. The role of enterprise architect entails:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Making important and (quite often) difficult decisions single-mindedly, to ensure the conceptual integrity of the enterprise’s business and IT; moreover, she needs to take those decisions early enough so that a plan is in place for everyone else to follow (see Activities EA-1, EA-2, and EA-3).
            </li>
            <li>
                Being cognizant to what is going on in the projects, watching out for important issues, and addressing them before they get out of control; at the same time, she has to work in intense collaboration across the projects (see Activities EA-5, EA-6, EA-7, and EA-8).
            </li>
            <li>
                Communicating at technical and nontechnical levels with conviction and restraint; quite often this requires us to stand up in a meeting and convey bad news to the sponsors or stakeholders in the most sensible manner (relates to all Activities EA-1 through EA-8).
            </li>
            <li>
                Keeping the organization on-ramp and on par with technology advancement in the industry (see Activities EA-1, EA-3, EA-5, and EA-6).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In a nutshell, the role of enterprise architect demands a plethora of multidisciplinary skills. This includes hard skills such as business acumen, technology expertise, and project management. Even more important are soft skills such as executive communication, collaborative influence, and organizational leadership.
