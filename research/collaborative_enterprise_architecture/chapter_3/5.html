            <h2>Developing and enforcing standards and guidelines (EA-5)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Until now we have looked at EA activities that are primarily strategic in nature. They identify why an enterprise needs to change, what it aims to achieve in a stipulated time horizon, and the possible paths of traversal. The outcome of these activities is strategy. The strategy is expressed in terms of business and IT maxims (see EA-1), architecture models (EA-2), and guiding principles plus a roadmap for the envisaged change (EA-3). It provides a long-term direction for the enterprise change.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we have seen, strategic issues are basically formulated in the boardroom and the CIO’s office. After that the enterprise architect has to bring them down to ground-level execution on the IT shop floor. He has to tell how the architecture should be implemented and by what technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The creation of standards and guidelines helps the EA do that. They offer a crystallization point where vision and strategy take a solid state and concrete shape. For instance, a business maxim stating that The security and privacy of customer information is non-negotiable can be turned into a series of security standards that the enterprise can impose on its projects and IT systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standards and guidelines are also an opportunity to synchronize the day-to-day activities on the ground with the vision and strategy. They can therefore also be looked at as a communication conduit between the boardroom and the staff on the ground, allowing them to communicate strategic decisions and receive feedback.

                    <strong>Standards and Guidelines: Shifting the EA Focus to Implementation</strong>

            <p>
                The standards are essentially the choices and constraints that are directly imposed on the design, development, and deployment of business solutions. The enforcement of standards is intended to meet strategic architectural goals—for instance
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Addressing enterprise-wide common concerns such as security, integration, and manageability in a consistent manner
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meeting the service-level expectations such as availability, fault tolerance, performance, and scalability in a cost-effective manner
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improving productivity in the solution development by encouraging reusability, repeatability, and rationalization
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensuring long-term viability of the solution implementation by promoting accessibility, interoperability, supportability, configurability, and extensibility
                </li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <p>
            Taking a top-down approach, the enterprise architect should derive the standards from the upstream business and IT maxims, architecture principles, and industry standards. 21 But the standards can also evolve bottom-up, as the corollary of the best practices and lessons learned during the projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, projects may develop a few common software components during their solution development, supporting common needs such as logging, single sign-on, online payment, connection pooling, and so forth. These components may then be formalized into a set of reusable libraries and frameworks that improve consistency, reliability, and productivity in future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            An enterprise architect is a key player here. Being well positioned to have a holistic view of the enterprise, she must be a driving force in identifying common IT needs of the enterprise, formalizing common ways of addressing them, and imposing them as standards for enterprise-wide usage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the top-down and bottom-up approaches carry certain benefits and risks. A top-down approach maintains the big picture but may be plagued with an “ivory tower syndrome” that might result in a blind and futile enforcement of standards. The bottom-up approach, on the other hand, is concrete and pragmatic by nature but may end up in unnecessarily proprietary solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a consequence, the formalization of standards is a continuous process, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches. The enterprise architect tracks emerging trends, conducts industry research, assesses technologies, and then standardizes the use of such technologies for an enterprise. At the same time, she assimilates experiences from the past projects to establish standards and guidelines for the future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            During that process, the enterprise architect always seeks to minimize the number of in-use technologies in order to enhance the manageability of the environment and to deliver a consistent set of IT services. It is a tight rope walk for the architects because it involves balancing the need for consistency in a large-scale system implementation with the need for diversity of solutions demanded by the business. This means in detail:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Consistency.</strong> In a large-scale system environment, consistency in solution implementation is critical. It enables predictability, fosters repeatability, encourages reuse, increases productivity, and improves manageability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Diversity.</strong> In a dynamic market environment, openness for a diverse set of solution implementations is equally important. It promotes innovation, enables business growth, and offers a competitive edge in the marketplace.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Standards are essentially meant to offer guidance to the project teams in selection and usage of technology while building their business solutions. Likewise, they are also meant to aid the architects in the governance of solution design and implementation in accordance with the target architecture.
