            Draupadi, 19 the heroine of the Indian epic Mahabharat, emerged as a full-grown woman from the sacrificial fire (Yagnya), and proclaimed to the whole world that she was immaculate. Unfortunately, we do not have any such mechanism to produce fully equipped enterprise architects “just like that.” The scarcity of enterprise architects (or the right IT resources in the right positions, in general) is quite evident in the IT industry. Despite attractive offers, many IT positions remain open, waiting long for “true love’s kiss.” In some cases, they are inappropriately filled, and in some others their tasks are silently stapled to the job descriptions of the enterprise architects.

            The face of IT is changing continuously and rapidly. On the one hand, it is becoming more commoditized, centralized, and outsourced. On the other hand, IT is venturing into providing value-added services to the business, like business process design, product design, business transformation and innovation. As a consequence, the portfolio of IT service offerings is expanding, and IT leadership is becoming more and more crucial. Ross (2011) states:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                If, despite the emergence of a digital or information economy, the business leaders are not positioned to lead IT-enabled business transformations (. . .), the need for IT to do so becomes acute (. . .). Ensuring the right talent to realize the IT organization’s ambitions is a critical challenge, many CIOs told us.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The question on the CIO’s table is: Is the current workforce equipped to adjust quickly and effectively to the challenges ahead? The activities in the IT unit are gearing toward business process engineering, architecture realization, and program management. This goes far beyond mere application development, system implementation, and project management, which were sufficient only a few years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a consequence, enterprises are realizing the importance of strategic competency management — an antithesis to the reactive demand fulfillment of the past. In the ideal case, they actively look at the future possibilities, demands, and constraints in the organization. This means developing long-term workforce plans, defining multiple career paths, investing heavily in their people, facilitating internal and external training programs, and offering rotations between business and IT roles.
