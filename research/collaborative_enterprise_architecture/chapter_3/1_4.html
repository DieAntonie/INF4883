            <h2>Identifying the initiatives</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Just envisioning the goals and stating the rules does not get things going. One also has to identify the strategic initiatives people should start working on. We intentionally use the term initiative because the plan of action is usually yet too coarse to speak of well-scoped projects. At this granularity, it is not about a proper project portfolio management: The how is widely unclear, there’s no target architecture in place, and all we have is intentions to start with. A typical scenario would be an imaginary car manufacturer, Cars4Us, which has committed to the goal of keeping existing customers. 1 A high-level business maxim aiming at this goal could be:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                We make the customer perceive us as a helpful companion, and we maximize the number of services and contact points accordingly.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The different business units of Cars4Us examine this maxim and come up with initiatives as to how to put this into practice. Customer care concludes they should point the customer to all service incidents and technical checkups in advance. Therefore, they take up a business initiative that models the whole life cycle of a car, with all probable events and corresponding interactions (car care, repairs, new purchase, etc.) with the customer. The IT initiative derived from it implements this process in the customer relationship management (CRM) system and automates such things as sending notification mailings about upcoming technical checkups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marketing, on the other hand, intends to extend the services beyond the narrow scope of car caretaking. They kick off an IT initiative centered on mobile applications in order to explore what kind of helpful gadgets could be offered on a smartphone. The range is wide: racing games with Cars4Us models, augmented reality manuals for the car, or apps alerting the user to events such as concerts or football games close by. The initiative is complemented by an investment into customer analytics. Cars4Us wants to learn about the customer and her wishes from the mobile interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example illustrates that there’s no way to systematically deduce the right initiatives. There’s not even a framework for guidance. One is left to one’s own creativity and a thorough understanding of the enterprise and the way the business is run.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initiatives usually do not directly lead to implementation projects. The latter are rather pursued by pre-projects detailing the requirements and target architecture to a level that allows for proper project planning of effort, business value, and risks involved.
