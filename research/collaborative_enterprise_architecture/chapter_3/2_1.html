            <h2>Models and views of various architectures</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Making architecture models probably is what most people primarily associate with the profession of an architect. Software developers expect the architect to come along with a blueprint for implementation. Managers expect they have to gaze at annoyingly complex diagrams when an enterprise architect starts explaining why a cable fire affected so many business processes.
        </p>

            Models are abstractions of some part of reality. They suppress irrelevant details but strive for being accurate with respect to the points of interests. Models are always bound to a certain purpose; otherwise there is no way to tell what is relevant and what is not. An enterprise architect, for instance, models the way IT is currently used in the enterprise as well as the roadmap to future use. But she typically does not model the air conditioning in the server rooms or the cabling for employee workplaces. What goes into the model and what is left out depends on the model’s use cases, and there is a wide range of things that can be done with an enterprise architecture model, namely:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Design and planning.</strong> The model is a tool for designing the future evolution of the enterprise’s IT. It is a means to identify the gaps between as is and to be and the corresponding needs for action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analysis and assessment.</strong> The model helps analyze the impact of incidents or changes. It allows assessing issues such as strategic fit, compliance with laws and regulations, or risks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Implementation and operation.</strong> The model is a framework of orientation for detailed design. It is a knowledge base for operating and maintaining information systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Communication and enforcement.</strong> The model is a foundation for explaining and motivating changes. It is a means to assure that the intended architecture is actually implemented in the intended way.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are probably more use cases than the ones we’ve listed, but this selection suffices to characterize the model as an important asset of enterprise architecture management. On the other hand, making and maintaining a model is laborious and expensive. Therefore, one should not ride a hobbyhorse when doing so but instead stick to what the actual use cases require. Striving for completeness, true-to-detail reproduction of reality, compliance to some architecture standard as an end in itself, or gold-plating the model is a waste of effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Communication is a use case deserving special attention. The enterprise architect uses the model to answer specific questions of stakeholders. Take, for example, the country head of an enterprise’s Mexican branch. He wants to learn about a new global business process that is planned to replace a local mode of operation. Concerns like this are not directly addressed by the model itself, and the enterprise architect is well advised not to present raw model material such as business process modeling notation (BPMN) diagrams to senior managers. Stakeholders have a specific viewpoint on a subject, and their perspective must be addressed by a corresponding view on the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The country head, in our example, wants to know whether the business process replacement changes the roles and responsibilities of his personnel, whether there are any investments needed, and how the IT total cost of ownership is affected. Other aspects such as strategic fit with the global IT strategy are of little interest to him. It is the enterprise architect’s job to draw a tangible view, custom-tailored for this specific stakeholder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The distinction between model and view is sensible and commonly made. 2 There actually are technically oriented people who believe that the model is the sheer truth, whereas views are what you “tell the kids.” But the enterprise architect who seriously takes the role of mediator between the various parties who have stakes in IT should abandon this somewhat nerdish attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            A holistic view of the enterprise’s IT requires more than one architecture to cover all aspects. On the business side, we have the business architecture that is concerned about the business goals, key performance indicators, organizational units, geographical locations, processes, business capabilities, and even more entities of the business realm. On the technology side there is the infrastructure architecture, consisting of servers, networks, data stores, software products, standards, frameworks, and further miscellaneous hardware and software thingies of which a runtime environment is composed. The TOGAF framework we are going to take a closer look at in Chapter 4, “EA Frameworks,” distinguishes as many as four different architectures that are layered from the business architecture down to the technology components: business architecture, data architecture, application architecture, and technology architecture.
