            Looking at the CEO vision, “Best-in- Class Customer Experience: Anywhere, Anytime, Any Channel,” CIO Dave Callaghan has recognized the pressing need for a comprehensive approach for integration within and beyond the bank. Dave has therefore translated the CEO vision into an IT maxim that says:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                Our systems must support new ways of doing business collaboratively with our partners and customers—an architecture that allows electronic bonding at more touchpoints and at a depth not previously attempted. The styles of electronic bonding should now include multidevice, service orientation, white labeling as well as the more traditional web portals and B2B gateways.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            For Oscar, this need for better integration is further fueled as a consequence of his decision to manage the technology areas in the bank at their edges rather than in their entirety. Since he intends to offer more local autonomy to individual technology owners (the IT delivery units themselves), he needs to ensure stringent control at their edges: their integration and interaction with the rest of the enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the ground, Ian Miller, the enterprise architect working on Oscar Salgado’s team, supervises all business projects around Closer to Customer for architectural conformance. It is a regular governance activity that he conducts in addition to his application rationalization mandate. He has recently observed a growing demand from the business side for enabling mobile channels, accessing mainframe data over the Internet, synchronizing customer data across disparate systems, and so forth.

            He has briefed the EA group about the need for a mobile platform, integrating to a host of heterogeneous back-end systems in the bank, and using a common integration layer. The EA team has opted for an SOA approach for the proposed integration platform, including the introduction of an enterprise service bus (ESB). However, no one in the current EA group has much insight into SOA. Oscar therefore recruits Shashi Malhotra, an SOA expert, into his team. Shashi joins the team with a mandate for ESB use at the bank. His task lists contains the following activities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provide a base to bed the ESB technology at Bank4Us
            </li>
            <li>
                Confirm the approach and understanding of ESB use and implementation
            </li>
            <li>
                Establish standards and guidelines for service development and integration
            </li>
            <li>
                Act as evangelist for future SOA opportunities at the bank
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will accompany Shashi in rolling out a pilot project on ESB use in the next subsection, “Monitoring the Project Portfolio (EA-6).”
