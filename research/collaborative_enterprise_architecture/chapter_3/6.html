            <h2>Monitoring the project portfolio (EA-6)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Project portfolio management begins with portfolio planning—normally a yearly exercise spinning off from activity EA-1, “Defining the IT Strategy.” Portfolio planning takes up the input from the IT strategy—business and IT demands, current gaps, maxims, and high-level strategic initiatives — and translates it into work packages for projects. The program managers, under the stewardship of the CIO, fiercely engage in defining, prioritizing, and estimating IT projects.

            What is a portfolio? A portfolio refers to an abstract collection of programs and projects gathered for management convenience. The constituents do not necessarily have a common business theme. The main purpose of the portfolio is creating value and maximizing return on investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            A program, on the other hand, is a collection of projects sharing a common business case or objective. It is meant to realize business benefits defined by the business case. In both cases, a project is a temporary endeavor to accomplish a prescribed unit of work, usually constrained by timeframe, budget, and deliverables. For the sake of brevity, key elements of portfolio, program, and project are summarized in Table 3-9.
        </p>

            It may be noted that the management attention and approach in portfolio management starkly differ from the traditional way of running projects. Without portfolio management, once a project has been funded its business value is normally not reexamined again. The monitoring focus is only on key metrics, such as quality, schedule, and scope. With portfolio management, however, you review the portfolio periodically—typically quarterly—and you question each project: “Does this project still make sense?”
        </p>
        <p>
            If it does not, you take corrective action. The projects are viewed in relation to one another, not as a stand-alone venture in isolation. This approach allows balancing the projects in the portfolio: High-risk projects are complemented by safe projects, short-term by long-term ones. One should continuously rebalance the portfolio to maximize the value and optimize the return on investment. The principles and approaches employed here are essentially those applied to managing a financial portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            IT portfolio management indeed stems from the concepts in financial portfolio management, whereas EA has its roots in architecture and technology. The two are separate disciplines and carry different genes. Yet they must be fully integrated with each other, as both have a common goal: Evolve the enterprise IT landscape in a strategic direction to maximize benefit realization in the long run. In the process, both practice areas attempt to take organizational politics out of IT investment decisions.
