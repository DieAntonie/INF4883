            <h2>General IT transformations</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The evolution of the IT landscape is not only driven by strategic initiatives—that’s a pivotal thing to note when we’re looking at IT transformations in general. What we mean by strategic initiative is something like Ian’s rationalization project at Bank4Us: The CIO issues a strategic goal, the enterprise architects work out a target architecture matching this goal, identify what has to be done, and mandate the vassals in the development and operational departments to put things into practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most enterprises we have seen so far, these strategic initiatives are not even the main force having an effect on the IT landscape. The decision of an automotive company to intensify marketing by adopting mobile devices or the plan of an ocean carrier to open a wide range of B2B services to logistics partners do not typically stem from the strategic board. In companies with good strategic governance, such initiatives are in line with the strategic direction, but they are nevertheless brought to the table and owned by business units. They also can bypass the desk of enterprise architects: The initiatives are run as business projects, and the target architecture consequentially is in the hands of project architects, who by majority do not belong to the EA group.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IT metamorphoses that enterprise architects encounter in practice are therefore a mix: In a few initiatives they are the masterminds; in a lot of others, planning and design is out of their hands. In those cases not owned by EA, the role of enterprise architects is limited to taking care that the evolution stays within strategic boundaries (see EA-5, Developing and Enforcing Standards and Guidelines) and to “backfilling” the architecture by integrating the solutions designed by others into the overall picture (see EA-6, Monitoring the Project Portfolio). The development of an IT landscape resembles more of a true evolution, where different actors and purposes try to push their business through, rather than a transformation planned by some mastermind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another peculiarity of Ian’s rationalization project is that it takes applications as a focal point. Applications traditionally are the units of ownership, deployment, and maintenance; they also are things that are internally well known and distinguishable as icons on the company desktops. But they are not the only possible focal point, maybe not even the best one in a modern architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dave Callaghan, the CIO of Bank4Us, also mandated customer empowerment as a strategic goal. But the customer view comprises products, contracts, services, business user interfaces, or customer processes. The enterprise’s applications are aliens from this viewpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wouldn’t it therefore be more natural to take the business architecture as a point of departure, instead of immediately gazing at applications? Then, the paramount step toward customer empowerment would be to draw a picture of the as-is landscape of services, business interfaces, and products and to design an improved to-be landscape offering more functions, processes, and a lighter access. Only the second step would then jump to applications and explore the options to support the envisioned business architecture by application functions and collaborations.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is roughly the order prescribed by the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM), which we take a closer look at in Chapter 4, “Architecture Frameworks.” The last step in ADM, leading to a full blueprint of the CIO’s customer empowerment mission, is mapping the application architecture to technologies—the software components, third-party products, standards, servers, routers, and what else there is when getting down to the nitty-gritty. This priority order—from business architecture over applications to technology—shifts the focus from a technology-centric to a business-centric design. It better fits initiatives that have a business momentum instead of an IT momentum, such as bringing down application costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The strong use of KPIs is the last peculiarity of application rationalization that needs to be differentiated when we’re looking at IT transformations in general. Many strategic goals are qualitative by nature, as we can see from the Bank4Us goal of customer empowerment, and their translation into quantitative values seems rather artificial.
        </p>
        <p>
            Often the assessment of target landscapes simply compares the different alternatives against a checklist of requirements. Compliance is noted by a checkmark, and the pros and cons of exceptions are discussed with regard to contents but without referring to numeric values. Nevertheless, it is worth striving for a KPI representation of qualitative goals, even if they are just unitless score values, as shown in Table 3-7. Three primary reasons count in favor of quantification:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The compliance with a generic goal, such as customer empowerment, usually is not a matter of “either/or” but of “more or less.” There are many shades of gray between “black” solutions that do not empower customers at all and “white” ones that make customers crowned regents. These shadings can only be captured by numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
                The assessment of alternative target architectures in EA covers a large area of the IT landscape. The cases in which one alternative outplays the others in all dimensions are rare and do not cause much headache. It becomes interesting if an alternative offers more customer empowerment in some applications but scores lower in others. In such a case, some aggregation algorithm is needed to come to a holistic comparison.
            </li>
            <li>
                The formulation of KPIs sharpens the understanding of a goal. This is in line with Lord Kelvin’s tenet that the ability to express something in numbers signals a deeper understanding of the subject. Qualitative is sometimes just a euphemism for fuzzy.
