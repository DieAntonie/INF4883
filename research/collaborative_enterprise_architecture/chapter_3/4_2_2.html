            <h2>Team composition</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            To begin with, the core team must have at least one full-time person who is fully responsible for the enterprise architecture. This is ideally the chief architect, appointed by the CIO. The chief architect is an executive position that serves a dual role:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Architect in charge for the enterprise’s IT landscape
            </li>
            <li>
                Chief program manager for enterprise architecture initiatives
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The chief architect is supported by the core team of architects, as described. The core team is typically a pool of enterprise architects that in turn is supported by an extended team of business, application, data, and infrastructure architects. Table 3-7 provides a typical listing of functional roles and associated responsibilities assigned to the core team members. Often some of these roles and responsibilities are shared, paired up, or contracted out.
        </p>
        <p>
            An architect usually operates at a particular level in the organization (enterprise, program, or project level). The position depends on her proficiency, experience, and seniority.
        </p>
        <p>
            If needed (typically in large organizational setup), the enterprise architecture effort may be treated as a formal program. In that case, the chief architect is equipped with a dedicated program management office (EA-PMO) for enterprise architecture. The EA-PMO is established specifically to manage and control the development, use, and maintenance of the enterprise architecture. The PMO is tasked with ensuring the success of enterprise architecture as per the stated performance measures while managing the finances and risks involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having formalized an EA organization in the enterprise, the health of EA should be checked periodically. This is essential to assess EA’s progress, effectiveness, and value contribution within the enterprise. The standard means of performing an assessment is to use an EA maturity model. We will cover this topic in Chapter 5, “EA Maturity Models.”
