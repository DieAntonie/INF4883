            <h2>The role of an enterprise architect</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Enterprise architects are typically not accountable for the enterprise’s IT strategy. It is the CIO who signs off on it and has to answer for it. Nevertheless, enterprise architects usually participate in strategic boards and meetings, prepare decisions, or elaborate drafts coming out of such meetings. There can be parts of the IT strategy on which enterprise architects have little to say—for instance, in defining service-desk policies. But even if they are not primary speakers in these parts, they are at least informed or consulted. Hence EA is deeply involved in shaping the enterprise’s IT strategy.

            Defining the IT strategy is a hot spot with regard to interpersonal issues, since it is on the borderline between business and IT and critically depends on the collaboration between the two. In a sense it is the stage for a culture clash, a meeting point of businesspeople on one side and IT folks with roots in programming on the other. On university campuses these two species looked at each other with suspicion, sometimes even with deprecation. If the atmosphere between business and IT is poisoned anyway, which is not a rare constellation, it is embarrassing how such meetings can easily distort into recriminations. The enterprise architect sits on the borderline between these two camps, and the best thing for him to do is to take on the role of moderator. This requires a good dose of political aplomb.
