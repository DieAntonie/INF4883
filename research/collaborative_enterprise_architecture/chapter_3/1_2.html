            There’s a broad consensus that defining the IT strategy is an exercise that cannot be achieved without an intense collaboration between business and IT. Broadbent and Kitzis (2005) regard the involvement of senior business executives in the definition of the IT strategy as the crucial factor in turning IT from a cost-generating infrastructure to a business enabler. Nevertheless, in practice it is difficult to get business executives on board.
        </p>
        <p>
            A proven approach to tackling this obstacle is the so-called management by maxims process conceptualized by Broadbent and Weill (1997). The process is far from being rocket science: It boils down to gathering the senior business and IT representatives for an intense one-day brainstorming workshop. The pain of business executives to devote some time to IT is thereby kept at a minimum. To make the most of such a day, there must be three topics on the agenda:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Definition of the business maxims
            </li>
            <li>
                Derivation of IT maxims out of the business maxims
            </li>
            <li>
                Agreement on the extent of shared services and infrastructure support
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For the day to be a success, the topics must previously be prepared by some assistants; the enterprise architects typically belong to this group. On the day itself, it might be just the chief enterprise architect who is invited to the illustrious workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first two agenda items are about maxims. Broadbent and Kitzis (2005) define a maxim as a “statement that specifies a practical course of conduct.” They recommend formulating not more than six business maxims that “[. . .] need to be concise, compelling, concrete, easily communicated, and readily understood as statements that people throughout the entire organization can use as guidelines for making decisions and taking actions.” Here are two examples of good business maxims taken from their book (2005, pp. 84, 91):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All sales employees are decision makers about taking new policies and cross-selling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximize independence in local operations with a minimum of mandates.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Deducing IT maxims from such business maxims is the second topic on the agenda. There can be more IT maxims than business maxims, but the catalogue should still be crisp enough to be remembered by members of the organization in their daily decisions. The two examples stated previously, for example, could give rise to the following IT maxims:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All sales employees, wherever they are, must have access to contract and customer data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Business units can determine the most suitable applications for their business, provided they comply with a minimum set of standards set throughout the enterprise.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The last item on the agenda is to get an idea of the enterprise’s need for shared services and infrastructure. The deeper rationale for this exercise is to position the firm (or maybe even individual business units) in what Jeanne W. Ross from the MIT Center for Information System Research calls an operating model. Ross (2005) distinguishes four main categories of operating models, as shown in Figure 3-2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technical people, especially technology-focused architects, have a bias for standardization and integration and tend to believe that these most naturally belong to the canonical goals of each enterprise. But it is not a matter of maturity in which of the quadrants of the Ross model an enterprise ends up; it depends on the business outlook, the competitive strategy, and the enterprise governance. Let’s take a brief look at each of these parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Broadbent and Kitzis (2005) distinguish three fundamental business outlooks, namely:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Fighting for survival.</strong> Budget cuts, layoffs, and cancellation of initiatives characterize this outlook. The emphasis is on cost reduction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Maintaining competitiveness.</strong> The enterprise is parsimoniously balanced between cost savings and investments in initiatives. Budgets are flat, and new initiatives must be thoroughly justified.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Breaking away.</strong> These are the happy days for new initiatives. Budgets are generous, and the challenge for IT is in keeping up with the growth, or even better, driving it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The second parameter following the business outlook that influences the need for standardization and integration is the competitive strategy. The economist Michael Porter (1998) describes three generic strategies that, on a rough scale, classify all approaches to competition. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cost efficiency.</strong> Offering a better price is the main competitive advantage. The emphasis is on operational excellence to keep costs low
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Differentiation.</strong> The enterprise tries to combat competitors by better products, quality, or customer care. The emphasis is on product leadership or customer intimacy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Focus strategies.</strong> The enterprise gains advantages from occupying market niches.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Even in the generic terms sketched here, it becomes evident that an enterprise architect who is much in favor of standardization and integration can do harm to an enterprise that is breaking away and strives for differentiation by developing the most innovative products on the market. While business is demanding a rapid positioning of new IT applications and services, the EA hits the breaks by imposing standardization and integration compliancy on the development teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enterprise governance is of equal importance as the previous two parameters. Weill and Ross (2004) define governance as a body of meta-regulations for management, stipulating the following issues:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What kind of decisions must be taken
            </li>
            <li>
                Who is accountable for making these decisions
            </li>
            <li>
                How decisions are made and eventually monitored
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            One core question decided by governance is how much autonomy is granted to business units or geographical regions. In case this autonomy is high, would a quest for high IT integration and standardization not be like fighting windmills?
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the enterprise architect must be aware of the business outlook, the competitive strategy, and the enterprise governance and must use them as landmarks in decision making. The maxim process provides a useful opportunity to call for information about these parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            A remarkable feature of the maxim process is that it is about abstract rules only. Broadbent and Weill (1997) coined the term management by maxims for a kind of strategy definition founded on abstract decision rules. This approach actually does away with a popular misunderstanding of what a strategy actually is. Elementary game theory defines a player’s strategy as a “complete plan of action for whatever situation might arise; a plan that fully determines the player’s behavior at any stage of the game, for every possible history of play up to that stage” (Wikipedia “Strategy,” 2011). The player becomes an executor of an algorithm in this conception, as visualized in Figure 3-3.
        </p>
        <p>
            But for complex games like chess, there is no algorithmic strategy that guarantees a win. Who would expect that there is an algorithmic plan of action that guarantees a successful transformation of the enterprise’s IT, a plan ensuring that all business goals are met? This algorithmic concept of a strategy has its limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Complex systems cannot be managed at an object level, only at a meta level. This will be one of our insights we discuss in Chapter 6, “Foundation of Collaborative EA,” where we reflect on the key implications of complexity. Management at a meta level basically means management by maxims.
        </p>
        <p>
            Existing frameworks for defining an IT strategy widely acknowledge this constraint. The TOGAF framework, for example, uses the term principle instead of maxim. But principles are defined as “general rules and guidelines [. . .] that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission” (The Open Group, 2009, p. 265). Thus, principle can in practice be regarded as a synonym for maxim. Principles are identified in the Preliminary and Architecture Vision phases of the TOGAF TM ADM, and they form a foundation for the subsequent architecture definition endeavor.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a good practice to accompany the bare statement of a principle by a rationale, a set of implications the principle might have, and possibly further auxiliaries such as metrics or the application context. This helps the decider and is recommended by TOGAF as well as by Weill and Ross (2004).
