            <h2>Pushing IT-focused effort into the portfolio</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            IT-focused effort comprises any activities that do not stem from a qualified business case or do not enjoy business sponsorship. Yet this effort is needed, if only to ensure better IT management. It comes in different flavors: migration, consolidation, decomposition, reengineering, replacement, or retirement of existing applications (or technologies, or infrastructure). It may as well be for incubation of new technologies in the enterprise: concept creation, technology research, prototyping, and piloting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of an IT-focused effort is to help the evolution of the IT landscape toward the target state architecture. Hence, as depicted in Figure 3-16, it usually falls under the premise of EA. In the absence of direct business sponsorship, enterprise architects have to find some way to add such IT-focused effort to the project portfolio. There are two ways this can happen:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Dedicated approach.</strong> The venture is executed as a separately funded project, often referred to as an infrastructural project. Normally the investments come from the CIO’s own IT budget.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Opportunistic approach.</strong> In this case, the initiative is included in the business-sponsored projects that are required as a result of new business requirements or major enhancements.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let’s again turn back to Bank4Us to see how this can happen there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ian Miller, the enterprise architect in charge of an application rationalization program, is looking at downsizing the legacy environment, for which he takes a deep dive into the bank’s current IT landscape and identifies rationalization opportunities. He uses the practices and techniques outlined in EA-3, Evolving the IT Landscape, to do that. He and his team have defined a series of work packages for the rationalization effort and now prepare the rationalization roadmap along with supporting cost/benefit analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oscar Salgado, the chief architect, is convinced that there are tangible rationalization targets that they must chase in the near future. However, the rationalization effort involves many, many stakeholders. It demands explicit and impartial funding—essentially to avoid any bias toward a particular business unit. Therefore, Oscar has taken the dedicated approach and seeks centralized funding from the CIO’s budget. He therefore catalogues all rationalization proposals in the current year for CIO sponsorship.
        </p>
        <p>
            In parallel, Oscar has observed that many business units, in their business plans, consistently express a need for mobile applications. These applications would help them interact more closely with their customers. Oscar has recognized a need for a common mobility platform and a need for better integration capabilities that can seamlessly integrate the mobility platform into the bank’s IT backbone. The top two priorities for the business are ease of integration and real-time access to information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oscar acknowledges that the current IT landscape lacks these critical capabilities in a big way. Hence, mobility and integration are on his radar during this year. As described in the previous section, “Developing and Enforcing Standards and Guidelines (EA-5),” he plans to pilot an enterprise service bus (ESB) as part of a more complete approach to integration at the bank. For that reason, he has recruited the SOA expert Shashi Malhotra onto his EA team to start working on the ESB mandate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stories of disillusionment with earlier attempts at enterprise application integration (EAI) are not yet forgotten at the bank. Oscar is cautious about the widespread skepticism toward and lack of experience in SOA. He prefers an opportunistic approach for the ESB deployment. Therefore, he instructs Shashi to set up an ESB infrastructure that can implement real-life integration scenarios at the bank. This infrastructure must demonstrate the applicability of SOA to the bank’s needs and address the integration needs and pain points of the business. This is a better way of getting the funding, and it will also keep the pilot effort relevant to the business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shashi consults with the program managers and their business counterparts. They work closely to come up with a list of integration scenarios in their projects that can be potential candidates for piloting. There are 14 of them. Shashi now needs to evaluate them and shortlist the most appropriate ones for his pilot project. To that effect, he prepares a questionnaire and seeks information about these integration scenarios from concerned business and IT experts. Shashi’s weighted scoring of the integration scenarios yields the scorecard depicted in Table 3-10. This scorecard helps him shortlist 4 out of 14 scenarios for his pilot project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pilot project has now been scoped; it covers typical integration requirements for the bank. As the next step, Shashi needs to come up with two things: ballpark cost estimates (how much product vendors and implementers will charge) and a fallback strategy (how to back out without risking the project if the ESB does not perform its job).
        </p>
        <p>
            Oscar finds Shashi’s approach sensible, practical, and safe. They now need to convince the respective program managers to apportion the ESB cost into their project estimates and be the first movers for ESB technologies at the bank.
