            Application rationalization is one special but prevalent example of EA-3, Evolving the IT Landscape. It also is an example of a transformation that is not driven by tangible functional requirements but by non-functional strategic concerns such as reducing costs or complexity. We have seen how KPIs are the pivotal tool to drive such transformations, right in the spirit of the often-cited tenet by Peter F. Drucker 14 that “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” They are the key to a precise understanding of the goals, crucial for identifying areas of improvement, and simulating the effect of changes. We also saw how deep dives into areas of improvement depend on how well an enterprise maintains its knowledge about its IT. Only if a sufficiently accurate and up-to-date model of the enterprise architecture is available, one can assess the impact of changes and simulate their costs and benefits.
