        <p>
            One of the top concerns while setting up a new enterprise architecture practice is to figure out who in the organization should do what. There are many questions to answer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How should the enterprise architecture team be organized?
            </li>
            <li>
                What skills does it have to possess?
            </li>
            <li>
                Where does it report to?
            </li>
            <li>
                How does it engage with other stakeholder groups?
            </li>
            <li>
                How is funding organized?
            </li>
            <li>
                What decision authority does it have?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The list is certainly not exhaustive. There are many options to consider, and there is no one right way to implement and operate an enterprise architecture practice. It depends on many organizational factors such as business imperatives, operational model, and governance structure of the enterprise.

            TOGAF, the Open Group EA framework that we will cover in detail in Chapter 4, does provide a few hints in this direction. The preliminary phase of the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) describes a typical approach for initiating EA for an organization. In addition, consulting firms like Gartner also help the organizations set up an enterprise architecture practice.
