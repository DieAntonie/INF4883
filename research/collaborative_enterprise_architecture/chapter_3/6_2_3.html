                Both architecture conformance and post-implementation reviews are opportunities for an enterprise architect to engage closely with project teams. On one hand, they allow the enterprise architect to guide the development effort and ensure that project teams conform to the strategic direction. On the other hand, they help her backfill the enterprise architecture by consciously gathering and assimilating the best practices and lessons learned in real-life projects.

                EA begins with conceptualization, idea generation, and philosophical preaching, but it gains substance only after gathering practical revelations from the projects on the ground. Hence these review processes can well be seen as mechanisms to backfill the enterprise architecture. They should enable two-way communication between the enterprise architecture and the project teams—guiding but also learning, governing but also getting feedback. We will discuss additional, innovative ways to do that in both Chapter 7, “Toward Pragmatism: Lean and Agile EA,” and Chapter 8, “Inviting to Participation.”
