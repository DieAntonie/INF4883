            In Chapter 1, we learned that Dave Callaghan, the CIO of our fictitious Bank4Us, mandated 20% savings over the next planning period in a strategic statement and explained further that:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                The savings will be attributed to legacy reduction/downsizing, reduction in number of system interactions, and reduction in IT operation/support cost.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, Bank4Us is running more than 3,000 applications in its data centers. Such a number of applications of different generations tends to proliferate to an entanglement that resembles a rampant jungle. Ian Miller and his group of enterprise architects take the CIO’s statement as an imperative to boldly thin out this jungle. But how can they accomplish this kind of cultivation?
