            <h2>Defining the goals</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Let’s first take a look at an example of a typical business goal: The automotive industry has become highly volatile in the past few years. Manufacturing plants are shooting up like mushrooms in emerging markets, and the car companies force their suppliers to keep up with this rapid pace. As a manufacturer of shock absorbers, for instance, you must be able to build up a new supply plant sufficiently fast wherever in the world your major customer decides to build cars; otherwise, you’re out. The ambitious goal your business management derives from this challenge is:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                We must be able to ramp up a plant in half a year in any geographic region, and we want to reach this capability in one year.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a business goal, and quite a good one. It scores quite high when benchmarked against the acronym SMART. This quality seal gathers the features a useful goal should have: Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound. The previously stated business goal could be a trifle more specific about the geographic regions and under what conditions a plant is considered “ramped up.” But it at least states a metric and the ramp-up time and nails down the time horizon of one year (it is time-bound). The addressees probably recognize it as relevant and roughly know the first steps to act on it (it is actionable).
        </p>
        <p>
            But in practice, one often finds that goals lack some or all of the SMART qualities. Mack and Frey (2002) list some caricatures of goals that are, for instance, absurdly unspecific: “Increase our market share,” “Make our products more attractive,” “Keep existing customers and acquire new ones.” It indeed is close to impossible to derive guidance from such goals—in particular if they just are a small excerpt of a long CEO Christmas list. Platitudes like this don’t pass the “Dilbert Test” illustrated in Figure 3-1: State the opposite, and watch whether something absurd takes form.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Christmas list, meaning the obstacle of an unfocused or even contradictory set of goals, can only be mitigated by urging the board of business managers to decide for a handful of them. If the business leaders decide to drop “Make our products more attractive” but not “Keep existing customers and acquire new ones,” we at least have a clue where the business is heading. Strategic initiatives consequentially should invest in marketing and CRM rather than in improving the product development or manufacturing chain. In most cases, however, the issue won’t be an “either/or.” Instead, prioritization of goals will be required, a step that inherently belongs to defining goals. A choice or ranking implies a mandate to act on, and the maxim process we shall describe a little later can help in pushing a business board to make it.
        </p>

            Several flavors of the term goal are in use. Some talk about objectives, some about requirements, and others swear by formulating visions. These flavors have their point, but in terms of the bottom line it is all about agreeing on what is wanted, how eagerly it is wanted, and maybe who wants it. There’s no need to be overly subtle about it.
