            <h2>Competency tree for an enterprise architect</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The first step in profiling an enterprise architect is to build a competency tree. This means identifying the competency areas relevant to the enterprise architecture, organizing them in a structure, and defining associated proficiency levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            A competency area entails the body of knowledge pertaining to a subject or a field of study. These can be areas as different as customer relationship management, enterprise data management, integration patterns, Web 2.0, agile methodology, or project management. The proficiency levels help measure an individual’s depth of knowledge and level of experience in a given competency area. The competency areas for an architect can typically be grouped under four main capability streams:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Business acumen.</strong> This pertains to an individual’s knowledge, skills, and experience in the specific business domain under consideration. For instance, the IT organization in Bank4Us needs broad and deep insight into the banking domain, ranging from the basic account-opening process in retail banking up to risk analysis and hedging of exotic derivative products in investment banking.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Technical expertise.</strong> This of course is the core competence required for any IT organization. It depends on the technology environment of the enterprise as to what expertise is required there. In Bank4Us, deep know-how in mainframe, Java/JEE, packaged CRM, Unix/C, and relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as Oracle, DB2, and MS SQL Server are valued.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Process excellence.</strong> This deals with the knowledge about main IT processes, comprising software engineering (for example, agile and waterfall), quality management, operational management (e.g., ITIL), program management, investment and risk management, procurement, and vendor relationship management.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Organizational leadership.</strong> This area primarily comprises people and behavioral skills pertaining to team leadership, intense collaboration, communication, and negotiation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A balanced competence framework should list about 10 relevant competency areas for each of the preceding capabilities. If needed, this structure can be further enhanced—for instance, by decomposing a competency area into a three-level tree showing a subject area (root), topics (branches), and learning modules (leaves). Such a tree is specific to the skills and experience requirements in a given enterprise and needs to be set up with hindsight into the context of market opportunities, organizational needs, and environmental constraints of that enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having defined the competency tree, the proficiency of an individual in a given competency area can be ranked using a set of evaluation criteria. Here is a suitable scale of five levels:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 1.</strong> Limited knowledge, basic awareness.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 2.</strong> Trained, conceptual knowledge, some educational background.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 3.</strong> Applied knowledge; is able to design and optimize a solution approach under supervision.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 4.</strong> In-depth knowledge; masters the current state of art and is able to design and optimize a solution approach independently; can guide project teams; acts as an advisor to others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 5.</strong> Expert; advances the state of the art; industry recognition; international publications; speaker at conferences (maybe even delivering keynotes); panel member in standards bodies.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Table 3-6 shows an illustrative enterprise architect skill profile for Ian Miller, enterprise architect at Bank4Us.
        </p>
        <p>
            One practical question remains: How should one measure and assess an individual’s proficiencies in each of the stated skill areas? A proprietary profile definition, as shown in Table 3-6, can be replaced or extended by adopting the Open Certified Architect (Open CA) program as a standard mechanism to benchmark an individual for her architectural competencies. Open CA is an architect certification offered by The Open Group. It qualifies an individual to be a practitioner architect based on a stringent evaluation of that person’s skills and experience in the role of an architect. The certification is offered at three role levels or positions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 1.</strong> Technical architect, typically architects working at project level.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 2.</strong> Master architect, for architects normally working at program level.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Level 3.</strong> Distinguished architect, usually architects focusing at enterprise level.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In essence, the Open CA certification program offers a yardstick to qualify an architect using fairly precise and measurable criteria. It is certainly not 100% foolproof, yet it is worth a serious attempt.
