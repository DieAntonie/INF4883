        <p>
            Before delving into the details of our improvement building blocks, Part I of the book first explores in detail what EA is. This part comprises Chapters 2 through 5:

        <section>
            <p>
                Chapter 2, “What Is Enterprise Architecture?” attempts a thorough definition of the term. Based on the generic meaning of the term architecture, we analyze the various facets of applying the term to an enterprise context.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Chapter 3, “What Enterprise Architects Do: Core Activities of EA,” we provide an overview of an enterprise architect’s tasks, structured into eight main activities, EA-1 to EA-8. Grouped according to these tasks, we describe the best practices in EA, as they are practiced today. Later in the book we will refer back to these activities when discussing measures to make EA more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Chapter 4, “EA Frameworks,” we describe the most well-known frameworks for structuring EA tasks and organizing an EA practice. Chapter 5, “EA Maturity Models,” rounds out the picture with an overview of maturity models—frameworks that allow us to assess how well a company is running its EA practice.

            Having examined the state of the art in EA, we come to our improvement proposals in Part II of the book, which consists of Chapters 6 through 8:

                Chapter 6, “Foundations of Collaborative EA,” comes back to the three guidelines for collaborative EA we stated earlier: the application of lean, agile, and Enterprise 2.0 concepts to EA. To begin with, we take a close look at complexity. What makes EA complex? And why can’t that complexity be managed well by a traditional top-down, up-front planning approach? We establish a theoretical foundation to reason out these questions. With a brief reference to management, organization, and evolution theory, we arrive at the Edge of Chaos concept that we have already outlined briefly. This idea further leads us to introduce the EA Dashboard that combines the EA caricatures from the preceding section with the Edge of Chaos concept. The EA Dashboard serves as a yardstick against which to measure successful EA practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the fundamentals of Collaborative EA laid in Chapter 6, we will turn back to concrete reasoning about corrective measures and practical steps to be taken. We have condensed them as six building blocks of collaborative EA and present them in Chapters 7 and 8. We measure the appropriateness and effectiveness of each building block against the EA Dashboard outlined in Chapter 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Chapter 7, “Toward Pragmatism: Lean and Agile EA,” we discuss how the application of lean and agile principles can render EA more pragmatic. We start off with a definition of lean and agile EA by transferring the main principles of Lean and Agile to the EA domain. In order to lay a solid foundation for our concept, we outline briefly the fundamentals of lean and agile software development, and compare both methodologies with each other. Finally, we describe our Building Blocks 1–3 (see Table 1-2 above) in detail. We will see how lean and agile thinking can be successfully incorporated into typical EA activities and processes, and how this will increase EA effectiveness, flexibility, and pragmatism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chapter 8, “Inviting to Participation: EA 2.0,” has a similar structure. First we describe the core concept of enriching the traditional EA methodology with collaborative Enterprise 2.0 mechanisms. As a foundation, we briefly outline the concepts behind Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0, with special hindsight to the use of these concepts in EA. Then we outline Building Blocks 4 through 6 (see Table 1-3) in detail. Each building block provides concepts that base EA on a more diverse, widespread judgment instead of restricting it to the wisdom of a few experts alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Chapter 9, “The Next Steps: Taking Collaborative EA Forward,” we conclude the book. After wrapping up the main ideas, we sketch the next steps for an enterprise architect who wants to implement some of these ideas in his or her daily work.

            We encourage you to use this book as a toolbox. You can read it from beginning to end, but you can also pick only those chapters or sections that seem appropriate for your work or your immediate problem at hand.

            We wish you as much pleasure reading it as we had writing it.
