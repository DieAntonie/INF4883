            In the previous section, we outlined how EA is supposed to function. For many enterprises this is a somewhat idealized picture. The real Ians and Sarahs of this world often do not meet regularly, sometimes look down on each other, or in the worst case, rarely ever talk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our jobs as architects and consultants, we have seen quite a few enterprises from the inside over the past few years. We have seen a large firm, where the absence of an effective EA yielded shortcomings across all organizational units in touch with IT:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Business managers who had no clear conception of how their business unit is utilizing IT
            </li>
            <li>
                Technical application owners who did not know which systems their application was interfacing with
            </li>
            <li>
                Developers who felt uncertain about which framework to use (and consequentially downloaded whatever they felt suitable from the Internet)
            </li>
            <li>
                Operational staff who desperately experimented with restarting a bunch of information systems in production because they had no idea about their interdependencies
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            On the other hand, we encountered companies that, despite having a fully institutionalized EA in place, were in a state close to paralysis. The conglomerate of business, organizational, and technical dependencies had grown to a muddle that made reasonable changes impossible. As a consequence, these companies were still able to operate their existing IT assets for daily work, but they were unable to move in any direction toward the future. They had usually gone through several not-so-successful application rationalization attempts over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            In one such case, the only possible way to find out whether an application was not in use anymore and could therefore be actually ramped down was to literally place a red phone beneath the hosting server and then shut down the server. If no angry calls came through for a period of one month, the conclusion that no one needed the application anymore was considered safe. Everyone can draw his or her own conclusions on such an approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            IT transformations being cancelled, a wrong portfolio of initiatives taken up, totally overambitious harmonization programs, anarchy due to ineffective governance—the list of possible IT blunders could easily be prolonged further. The reasons for such problems are usually manifold, of course, and cannot be pinned down to malfunctioning enterprise architecture alone. However, as we saw in the previous section, EA is supposed to prevent such failures—so why do they keep happening?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s take a closer look at the situations in which EA is not living up to its promises, then attempt an analysis of the reasons why not.
