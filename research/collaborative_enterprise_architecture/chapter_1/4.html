        <p>
            After this analysis of EA shortcomings, let’s look forward again. We do not want to appear like a bunch of notorious bickerers: We also came across many enterprises in which a neat EA practice indeed showed its benefits. But there always was wide room for improvement, and tendencies to the one or other caricature described in the previous sections were always perceptible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our analysis of EA failures and shortcomings has revealed that EA needs to find its proper position in a complex and chaotic environment. The solution is not about eliminating chaos altogether. That would overstretch the meager powers of the EA or IT organization, or it could turn EA into an overly rigid control freak—just the other side of the coin.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we will see, the real issue is to balance chaos and order properly. The question is how to leverage chaos to increase orderliness. “Chaos is created by people trying to solve immediate business problems, [and] you need to harness that energy even if it creates systems chaos,” writes Eckerson (2011). The answer is given by a concept called the Edge of Chaos, originally introduced by Kauffman (1995) and Brown and Eisenhardt (1998). In brief, this concept states that any dynamic system works most effectively when order and chaos are in balance. Both too much order and too much chaos are counterproductive. We have incorporated the Edge of Chaos into an EA Dashboard that measures this order-chaos balance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The EA Dashboard, as depicted in Figure 1-2, 14 is a yardstick to measure any improvement proposals for EA. It is based on the dimensions of EA complexity introduced in the previous sections. We will introduce the classification criteria in detail in Chapter 6. As a general rule, based on our analysis of the EA failures in the previous section, it makes sense to seek a middle ground between the extremes on each gauge. We will measure the potency of our proposed EA improvements against this Dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            But how can we achieve balancing EA between the extremes on the EA Dashboard? We do not believe we have the panacea for all grievances about EA. Nevertheless, something must be done to prevent EA from slipping into the gray mediocrity of yet another IT function that doesn’t make an essential difference. This is basically what this book is about: proposals to take action. There is a lot to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opposed to a trend in recent publications to attack from the top down, from the more shining business and CxO perspective, our own professional roots are at the worm’s-eye view of IT. This does have an effect on the approach of this book, too. Any optimization for EA needs to make sure that all stakeholders are on board and that they remain involved along the way—the business, the IT crowd on the ground, management, and the enterprise architects themselves. This idea can be summed up in two main challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How can we structure EA activities on a day-to-day basis in order to master a demand-driven workflow at all levels of operation and achieve a holistic result?
            </li>
            <li>
                How can we elicit the participation of all, in particular the ground-level stakeholders, to balance the helicopter view and the ground-level perspective?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our answer to these questions is to introduce lean, agile, and participation concepts into EA. We encapsulate our proposals for enriching the traditional way of doing EA in six building blocks. The first three are based on lean principles and agile practices from erstwhile software development, whereas the remaining three are drawn from Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0 concepts. These building blocks are the cornerstones of Collaborative Enterprise Architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            In software development, as project architects, we worked for years with lean and agile methods. Instead of the inflexible waterfall model, we could use a lightweight, efficient, and human-centric approach. It helped us move away from strict and error-prone up-front planning, which was only needed to avoid changes later on. With lean and agile methods, we could approach complex problems in an iterative fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another finding from the EA failures analysis is that EA is too often practiced in isolation. Sometimes this is deliberate, with an elitist mindset that considers only high-level decision makers, such as the CxO and the immediate next-level management, worth talking to. Sometimes it just happens—out of under-empowerment, from too much attention to detail or to concepts, and for other reasons. The countermeasure here is to introduce more participation of groups outside the “inner circle” into decision-making processes.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Three Guidelines of Collaborative EA</strong>
                </p>
            </header>
            <p>
                Altogether, our improvement approach for EA adheres to the following three guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Establish a lean set of processes and rules instead of overloading the stakeholders with bureaucratic processes and unsolicited artifacts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adopt evolutionary problem solving instead of blueprinting the whole future rigidly on a drawing board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Foster and moderate open participation instead of relying only on experts and top-down wisdom.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <p>
            Practicing lean and agile methods means welcoming change, planning and executing incrementally, and focusing on structured human interaction instead of channeled reporting lines. These methods are an enabler for a reduced and efficient organization to deal with complexity—exactly what EA needs. By applying these methods to the creation of architecture instead of the creation of software, we follow the first two guidelines of collaborative EA in dealing with EA activities on a day-to-day basis.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The focus on continuous deliveries avoids an EA that is simply dreaming of the future instead of realizing short- and mid-term benefits.
            </li>
            <li>
                Synchronization points (iterations, demos, frequent planning, and feedback workshops) ensure that EA is aware of the demands of the stakeholders and can easily adapt to changes in their requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lean, as the second element our proposals, teaches us how to establish lightweight processes. Work items are pulled by demand instead of being pushed under (often false) assumptions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The practical implementation of these concepts has been condensed into three concrete building blocks, as outlined in Table 1-2. We will discuss them in more detail in Chapter 7, “Toward Pragmatism: Lean and Agile EA.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The implementation of the third guideline, fostering participation, is provided by three further building blocks, as shown in Table 1-3. They invite different user groups to contribute their knowledge, assessment, and opinion. They imply a paradigm shift from a one-sided reliance on subject matter experts to the wisdom of crowds being aroused by open-mined knowledge sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Building Block 6, Participation in Transformation, for instance, shows a neat way to close the ubiquitous, awkward breach between enterprise architecture and implementation reality. The core tool is an architecture social software platform that is well integrated into other tools such as a configuration management database (CMDB) or dedicated EA tools. This platform can be a weapon against the divergence of high-level vision and ground-level facts. A detailed discussion can be found in Chapter 8, “Inviting to Participation: EA 2.0.”
