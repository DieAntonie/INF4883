            <h2>Transformation: Between standstill and continuous revolution</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            An IT landscape requires continuous evolution. Concentrating only on the operational aspects of IT will not be enough to meet future challenges. Both the innovations on the business side—new products, markets, and business models—and on the technology side, require a constant renewal. It is one of the core tasks of EA to plan and monitor this evolution. The change is either executed in smaller, incremental projects or as large-scale IT transformations. If the pace of change becomes too high, the operability of the whole IT system is at risk.

                If the EA group drives the change in IT at such a pace that all stakeholders gasp for breath, the success of the IT transformations and the proper functioning of IT as a whole are at stake. This situation is often encountered at startups with lots of cash or in enterprises operating in innovative and booming markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here the management is usually technophile and the EA organization dominated by innovation-hungry IT enthusiasts. This mix can lead to a mercurial strategy of radical changes toward the newest technologies without really understanding them in depth. The IT department has no time to develop a mature and consistent technology use; around the corner, the next technology hype is already attracting the focus of IT planners and decision makers.

            On the other side of the spectrum, many ambitious IT-enabled business transformation programs come to a complete halt after encountering the harsh realities on the ground. Here is a fictitious example based on a real case. An initiative called Global Spark was undertaken in a manufacturing firm with the following mission statement:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                Our strategic initiative Global Spark will deliver a single-instance Order-to-Cash (OTC) platform for worldwide operation that will vastly improve our customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Thereby it will yield over $215 million in immediate quantifiable benefits and an additional $95 million in year-on-year ongoing benefits.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The intent of the program was to leverage operational synergies among different business units spread across the globe and present a single face of the organization to customers around the world. However, two years down the line, the progress report of the Global Spark program read like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                Global Spark is being implemented by a leading multinational systems integrator. The development of the technology platform has been under way for two years now. The functional requirements have changed three times, and current requirements are still considered to be in draft state by the major stakeholders. The program was scheduled for completion in an 18-month timeframe but has now been extended to 36 months. It was initially budgeted for $20 million, but we expect costs of $38 million as of now. To date the project has already spent $4 million in requirements gathering, business process analysis, and project planning.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            In retrospect, when we look at why so many of these initiatives go wrong, we find that there are many challenges inherent to the complex nature of project management in IT. Quite a lot of these challenges are attributed to the risks involved in new technologies, new processes, and their adoption in mainstream business.

            The popular blunders described in the list below are not caused by EA failure. However, a well-functioning EA is able to prevent the worst damage—for instance, by monitoring and timely escalation wherever needed in the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Pet programs.</strong> Often enterprises take up wrong initiatives in the first place. Initiatives are merely shaped without charting a clear strategy or getting buy-in from all the stakeholders. “Pet programs,” usually initiated at the behest of an individual sponsor without a roadmap of their long-term viability, become a problem. By definition, pet programs get a level of attention and investment that is not justified by their value. The problem becomes particularly visible if the sponsor moves on to a different job and her successor does not see the need for the program anymore. Once started, these programs acquire a life of their own and are rarely terminated, even after the sponsor’s exit. Pet programs erode an organization’s bottom line and are a severe drain in terms of costs and resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Poor program management.</strong> Another obvious problem is poor project execution. This includes aspects such as inaccurate estimation of the work involved, poor reuse, extensive rework, redundant parallel effort, abrupt project termination, placing projects on the shelf, and production back-out. When inappropriate governance joins hands with poor project execution, the initiative loses momentum. Typically cases of inappropriate governance occur where the sponsors or other stakeholders, rather than the program manager alone, are also accountable for failure. The most common reasons for this situation would be lack of dialogue between business and IT stakeholders, complex cross-organizational engagements, poor accountability, and a major change in business direction partway through the program.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Over-ambition.</strong> This is one of the most frequent causes of failure. It leads to cramping of too many requirements in a single release and, quite often, in the first release. The scope-creep does not leave any ground for priority management or schedule management during the project execution. Furthermore, scheduling too many programs for the available resources eventually leads to a setback in plans. The same applies to scheduling too many programs that focus only on a particular area of the organization, which then is unable to sustain the total pace of change. Every organizational group has only a limited capacity to absorb change. Exceeding that capacity creates a bottleneck and often makes a program fail.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Technology risks.</strong> The risks in new technologies, and the ability of the enterprise to adopt new technologies, can endanger success. The immaturity of a technology platform or the inadequacy of a technology for the problem at hand are often overlooked under the pressure of releasing a solution in time. Technologies are volatile; they evolve continuously, or even worse, they come and go. Consequently technology platforms change in rapid succession. Although technology providers tend to ensure that their platforms have a support life of at least five years, in reality this is much less due to the lead times and delays within the enterprise while migrating to the newest version.

                An EA organization that neglects change programs in the IT landscape—whether for lack of budget, planning capacity, strategic direction, or other reasons—just piles up a debt of necessary changes and adaptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the enterprise architect is not driving change in the IT landscape but merely documenting it, he turns into a chief librarian rather than an architect of the IT landscape. The EA organization deteriorates into a documentation graveyard. The probability is low that someone will ever do anything useful with models and documents just stockpiled without an explicit purpose. And if these documents and models are indeed revisited at some point, chances are that they will be hopelessly outdated by then.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            Of course, despite all risks in IT transformations, avoiding them altogether (a sketched in the caricature The Ever-Growing Backlog) just piles up a debt of necessary changes and adaptions. Reducing the system changes to only the most needed maintenance activities is only advisable for low-value-contributing support systems, which are run in the most cost-efficient way. Ultimately, change will always be required in some form or the other. Therefore, a well-working EA function is needed to deal with it.
