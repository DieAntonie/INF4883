        <p>
            Today’s businesses face an unprecedented level of uncertainty and fast pace of change in their operating environments. Still, EA in general often favors the grand vision, the long-term-oriented strategy projected several years into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, many EA initiatives tend to inherit the bureaucratic behaviors rooted in typical large enterprises. Therefore, today’s EA, to a large extent, sticks to the work culture of the 1990s and shows many of the traits of a waterfall software development life cycle. This means long review and approval cycles for strategy programs, favoring a strategy that looks forward many years.

                Enterprise architectures should not point too far into the future; otherwise they lose touch with reality. After a period of three years, both business situations and technology trends may change dramatically. Any strategy reaching beyond that time period therefore bears the risk of being based on speculation. The EA group may fall victim to tunnel vision, blinding out the creeping deviations of current reality from the projected future.
            </p>
            <p>
                This situation is often accompanied by the analysis paralysis phenomenon: The enterprise architects are so entrenched in their strategic analysis activities that they do not have time for much else.
            </p>
            <p>
                All stakeholders outside the EA group will perceive such types of planning as being executed from the ivory tower. This can decrease the appreciation of strategic planning as such—a dangerous path.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            Against a backdrop of a volatile and fast-paced business environment, an overly long-term strategy bears many risks. If the milestone for a strategic vision points too far into the future, the impact on the daily business is low. Here the pace of change is painstakingly slow. 12 This further widens the chasm between high-flying visions and the IT reality on the ground, often to a point of outright absurdity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Frequently it does make sense for EA to be “deliberately myopic” about the long-term future. Gartner (2010) recommends that EA have a large portfolio of short-term strategies (around 3 to 12 months) instead of one grand vision. The expectation from the business side is to see incremental progress rather than hoping for a grand novelty far in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Short-term strategies can be planned, executed, monitored, and adjusted incrementally within the context of prevailing dynamics of the external business and technology environment. Even if there still is a long-term vision in place, it is imperative for the enterprise architect to show some short-term benefits. Only that ensures that she can survive long enough to see the fulfillment of the long-term promise. This requires a certain paradigm shift for EA—from strategic to incremental, from meticulously planned to exploratory.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other end of the spectrum, very far away from the grand vision, the ultimate hands-on mentality rules. The rush to see quick wins can become so desperate that the enterprise architect ends up addressing tactical issues and plucking only low-hanging fruit. In that case, the EA team ends up not doing any strategic planning at all. Instead, the enterprise architects concentrate only on architecting minor changes to ensure day-to-day operability. Of course, this can no longer be called EA.

            <p>
                If the enterprise architect applies too little strategic long-term thinking, the gap analysis between as-is and target states of the architecture is prone to deteriorate into a log of upcoming change requests. Talking to the business users is a very sensible activity for the enterprise architect. However, if she merely records the wish list without abstracting it into a future vision for the IT landscape, she reduces her role to that of a secretary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other indications of such a situation is that the EA tool is used as a software change management system and that the future state descriptions read like the solution architecture for the next upcoming software release.

            Ultimately, the enterprise architect needs to determine at what point she should concentrate on the strategic intent of the enterprise and when it’s time to turn to the tactical priorities on the ground—in other words, when she is running a marathon and when she’s running a 100-meter run. These are seemingly different races, and the enterprise architect has to find the proper balance in between.
