            Although EA has reached the mainstream, a skeptical undertone with regard to its effectiveness has always existed. In 2004, after completing many years of EA effort, the General Accounting Office (GAO) 5 reported a standstill in EA maturity within US government agencies: “Of the 93 agencies that we reported on in 2001 and 2003, 22 agencies (. . .) increased their maturity, 24 (. . .) decreased their maturity, and 47 (. . .) remained the same” (U.S. GAO, 2004, p. 27). In another account, an online survey revealed that the overwhelming majority of participants doubt the success of EA programs, at least within the first couple of years (Spacey, 2011). 6

            EA has not yet fully proven that it provides tangible business benefits in the same way that other enterprise functions do, compared to the effort and cost it accumulates. Although EA is all about business-IT alignment, it is historically an offshoot of the IT organization. Often enough it is a part of the IT organization and run by IT people, with only marginal participation from the business side. 7 Even if the real business problems are actually addressed, the cost-benefit justification is often IT-centric and fuzzy. It is based on the perceived value of architecture rather than using a viable proof point about the actual business value delivered in a real-life scenario. The business sponsors, however, want to know what EA actually delivers, not what it “could” deliver.

            Does that mean that EA, in its current form, is too amateur to meet the needs of the time? Of course, our answer is No—otherwise we would not have written this book. But neither is it the shining white knight who renders all criticism obsolete. EA is needed and useful. But the way it is practiced today still has shortcomings that should be resolved in order to boost its universal acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adopting a harsh critic’s perspective, one could claim today that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                EA does not scale to create any visible impact in a large enterprise setup.
            </li>
            <li>
                EA is not equipped with the right approach and toolset to cover the entire scope of work, from strategy through implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                EA fails to keep pace with the speed of change in modern business.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Yet, according to literature and our own experience, spectacular failures happen only in a minority of EA programs. As a general rule, case studies documenting the effect of an EA program—whether success or failure—seem to be rare. Especially we have not found any documented cases where EA programs have actually been cancelled and the EA organization disbanded. More often, EA seems to slip into a gray mediocrity: Fulfilling some promises but failing others. An EA organization working in this mode is still too lively to be abandoned but does not have enough strength to effectively set the course for the whole IT organization.

            We will take a closer look at the challenges and failures of EA in the coming sections. The four dimensions depicted in Figure 1-1 will serve as a structure for our analysis. We will come back to them later, when describing building blocks for a collaborative EA, designed to tackle the identified EA problems:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Perspective.</strong> What viewpoint does the EA group take? Does it prefer a “helicopter perspective” with little involvement in the hands-on IT business, or do its members involve themselves knee-deep in concrete architecture work in programs and projects?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Governance.</strong> How strict is the adherence to, and enforcement of, rules set up by the EA group? Does the organization follow a laissez-faire approach, where each project has a high level of freedom, or is a rigorous control system in place to supervise compliance?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategy.</strong> To what extent does the EA group focus on strategic planning, and what is the typical time horizon of the plans? Does EA follow the one “great vision,” or—at the other extreme—is there no long-term planning at all?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transformation.</strong> What is the speed of change in the landscape of business models, processes, and IT systems? What kind of IT transformations are taken up?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We have condensed some of the more frequent practical EA anti-patterns (collected from own experience, some expert interviews, and material documented in literature 8 ) into eight EA caricatures interspersed in the following text and summed up in Table 1-1. The caricatures match the extreme positions in each dimension. They exaggerate reality to bring out the essence of the problem more clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each dimension, the EA group should find its proper position between the extremes. This does not guarantee a catch-all solution as to how to do EA properly, but it provides a grid to classify the most common problems. No EA group will be a 100% version of a caricature—but so far, we have not encountered any organization that didn’t show at least some of its traits.
