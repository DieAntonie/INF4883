            <h2>Aligning business and IT</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The world of business is rapidly evolving; customers are demanding more sophisticated products and better services. The convergence of communication and computing is opening up avenues for new business models and revenue streams. The IT systems must support new ways of doing business collaboratively with partners and customers. The result is a “multi-entity” ecosystem that allows interaction at more touchpoints and a depth not previously attempted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today’s business challenges are not going to be met by simply adding a few systems here and there nor by tidying up a few platforms in the enterprise IT landscape. The only solution may be to completely restructure the enterprise’s operational and organizational regime in the new environment. It will be a transformational journey that has to start with EA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of enterprise architecture is to act as a guide, perhaps a pathfinder, who takes the enterprise on a transformational journey—from an incoherent and complex world with line-of-business separation, product-specific stovepipes, legacy systems estate, and costly operation to a more rationally organized and useful state with multiservice, revenue-generating platforms and an efficient operational regime. On the way, radical surgeries may be required to eliminate duplication, reduce costs, improve reliability, and increase agility in the business. EA acts as a strategic foundation for business enablement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The transformational journey that begins with EA is long and hard. The effort may be cost-justified by identifying IT-centric benefits, but the real value of enterprise architecture can only be appreciated when it delivers tangible business benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The enterprise architect must envision how EA will change the way the enterprise operates and how large the generated business benefits will be to outweigh the effort spent. The benefits must be realized in view of both long-term and short-term business priorities. For instance, when embarking on a multiyear plan for the deployment of a unified, strategic service-oriented architecture (SOA) platform for the enterprise, the business should be able to see the benefits of such a platform early enough (say, within the first six months) and then periodically thereafter (for instance, every three months).
        </p>
        <p>
            In Bank4Us, the EA initiative “Closer to Customer” is geared toward delivering the following strategic business benefits:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer empowerment.</strong> Customers should be enabled to manage their own banking environments (in buzzword lingo: “self-service, zero-touch, in real time”).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer intimacy.</strong> The IT systems should provide personalized customer service based on an intimate knowledge of the customer’s needs, behavior, and lifestyle.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer satisfaction.</strong> Operational synergies across the different lines of business should be leveraged to reduce the cycle time and failure rate in all customer interaction processes; that will help implement a true single face to customer concept.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer excitement.</strong> Finally, the customers should be excited by innovative products and services. This allows the bank to respond to competitor initiatives and market opportunities in an agile fashion and to be the first in the market (or at least an early follower).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This list brings an interesting pile of activities for Ian. The starting point for any major activity in the bank is a business case; this has to be driven from the business side. Ian plans to participate in its creation process in order to understand the broader business perspective of the “Closer to Customer” initiative and to keep track of the big picture of the bank in his mind. Over a period of some weeks, he confers with various business stakeholders. One of them founds an informal working group with several other business managers and invites Ian to participate as a member of the EA team. The group begins with the preparation of the business case document for harmonizing the key customer-facing business processes across the five business lines of the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
            The business case refers to the process maps for three customer-facing business processes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Prospect to customer (customer win)
            </li>
            <li>
                Need to fulfillment (customer servicing)
            </li>
            <li>
                Trouble to resolution (complaint resolution)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The case further highlights that the processes are, to an extent, similar across all business lines. There is about 30% commonality, but there’s also a potential for much more standardization across the business lines. The business stakeholders estimate that the processes could even be unified to a degree of 80%.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a next step, the business case also looks at the customer satisfaction goal that requires reducing the cycle times and failure rates in these customer-facing business processes. It explores the possibilities to measure the cycle time for the processes in an automated way. This would allow the business to effectively monitor and optimize the end-to-end process time in the future. It also identifies common failures and their effects in these processes. After many discussions, and by taking an active support role in compiling a business case and supporting documentation, Ian gains a decent understanding of the high-level business requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ian prepares an IT proposition in response to the business case documentation. The proposition highlights opportunities for process harmonization, data standardization, and capability reuse in the bank’s operating IT environment. In addition, Ian gives a recommendation to the sponsors as to how they could monitor and optimize the customer-facing processes for minimum cycle time and straight-through processing with the help of available technologies. He gets his proposition vetted by Sarah and her peers and finalizes it for discussion with the sponsors and users on the business side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ian is wary from the litany of unsuccessful enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and similar IT-inspired programs. He has come to realize that IT alone is not enough to bring about a transformation. If the business leaders do not share ownership of both the implementation and the outcome, the path to IT transformation will be a disastrous journey. On the other hand, the business can neither simply rely on IT nor lead IT-enabled transformations. Hence the business expects IT to step up to the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            For that purpose, Ian manages to involve CIO Dave Callaghan via his boss, the chief architect. Ian asks Dave to first generate a widespread agreement among business leaders as to the appropriateness of the CEO’s vision and the IT-enabled transformation. Dave, in partnership with his counterparts on the business side, assures a joint ownership for the transformation. This step helps to get the program staffed adequately so that the necessary expertise is available on both the business side and the IT side. Dave now formally sets up a joint working group between IT and business and assigns Ian, Sarah, and others to that group.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a next step, Ian participates in the brainstorming sessions with the subject matter experts from business and IT across the five business lines in order to review his proposition and resolve issues raised by the stakeholders. He applies some changes to his document to accommodate the stakeholder needs. This is the most challenging exercise that demands deep collaboration among all stakeholders, who come from different professional backgrounds and organizational cultures and may even have competing priorities. Luckily, the essence of Ian’s ideas has survived this crucial process. He now expects Sarah and her peers to budget and plan further for this initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the initiative has been approved, Ian takes this effort forward by working closely with Sarah and her peers. Jointly they identify those capabilities they can use from existing systems versus those they will need to buy or build anew. In the process, Ian looks at opportunities to maximize the reuse of applications, data, and infrastructure. He guides the project architects in defining the solution architecture and the deployment plan. Ian also identifies the initiatives that will enable change and bring in new technologies, if needed. Eventually Ian has to guide and govern the project implementation to make sure the intended outcome is achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether EA is perceived as a hygiene factor for the IT landscape or as a strategic foundation for business enablement, it is obliged to deliver value. As a hygiene factor, benefits from EA can be valued in terms of reduction in management escalations, emergency occurrences, and year-on-year operational expenses. As a strategic foundation, EA facilitates the deployment of new capabilities. This way it helps IT gain more business trust—and hence more funding for new IT projects. Unfortunately, these benefits are difficult to quantify on a short-term base. Therefore they need to be tracked over a sufficient time period and then be normalized to a common baseline. Only then can they serve as a sensible benchmark for measuring the success of EA.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is just a brief snapshot of EA activities. We will delve into the details in Chapters 2 through 5, where we present a more thorough definition of EA and give an overview of the practical activities, methods, and concepts it involves. For now, this overview should suffice to give you an impression of what the job of an enterprise architect comprises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bank4Us is not an enterprise architect’s wonderland, but by and large EA is still able to perform its tasks. The practice on the ground is often more complex and less well organized than depicted in the story of Ian and Sarah, at least in many enterprises. Let’s now look at this less glossy reality.
