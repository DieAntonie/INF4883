            Any EA practice that has existed for some time has accumulated a vast amount of knowledge comprising a multitude of principles, policies, procedures, practices, techniques, lessons, and so forth. Depending on the organization’s style, this knowledge is enforced with more or less vigor. That, however, does not guarantee the practical relevance of this knowledge. Often EA principles are perceived as a veritable nuisance by the practitioners on the ground.
        </p>

            We were involved in the development of a Web-based workflow system for a reinsurance company. The project architect had proposed to use an industry-standard Web framework supporting page flow and transaction management in a very suitable way. The framework was in use in other systems within the company as well and was on the list of accepted technologies. Still, the EA group insisted on the proprietary standard user interface platform, which would have meant at least 50% more effort and a hefty project delay. Only after an escalation to C level was the project architect allowed to continue with the original choice.

            Many EA-originated policies that appear obsolete today have not always been meaningless. Most probably they have emerged as the architecture group’s overreactions to unlikely-to-recur situations that they experienced in their organization in the past. A frequent example is the uncontrolled proliferation of newly hyped technologies by the IT crowd, and the EA group’s rigid attempt to reinstitute order. Once the technology has matured, the EA rules often appear overly strict and suppress a flexible use of the appropriate technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            As time passes, policies tend to become stale. Given the unpredictable and rapid changes that happened over the last decade, it is obvious that many of them do not carry much prominence today. Nonetheless, they still continue to be part and parcel of enterprise architecture. EA should therefore also continuously check and revise its policies.

                Sometimes the EA organization has an overly rigid approach to enforcing its own standards. Instead of discussing a sensible level of standardization with the IT crowd on the ground, enterprise architects invest their energy in political fights for IT standards that are irrelevant at best and that stall creativity at worst. Examples of standards with the risk of being applied in an overly strict manner are the exclusive use of SOAP-based Web services as a data exchange protocol for all kinds of internal and external interfaces, or a certain UI platform prescribed for all clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, if enterprise architects claim to be the only decision-making body in technical matters, there is a huge risk that they create a bottleneck. If decisions take ages due to pending strategic issues, imminent changes in the business model, and so forth, IT projects can be seriously delayed. The practical consequence is that projects deliberately circumvent the enterprise architects—for example, by choosing less suitable technologies not managed by the EA group.
            </p>

        <p>
            An overly rigid EA governance is prone to producing a rampant bureaucracy of approvals and sign-offs. From experience we know that a sign-off rarely means that the matter is really closed. The approved document is usually not questioned or openly disregarded. Instead, the reality on the ground—in the IT department, in the projects implementing parts of an IT transformation—slowly creeps away from the documented status. The predominant effect reached by too much focus on formal governance is that the EA group and the executors on the ground just stop talking to each other. The EA group thinks everything is settled in their sense, and the practitioners are happy to have the EA guys off their back.
        </p>

            The preceding caricature, the Guardians of Wisdom, paints a picture of an EA group whose extensive controlling attitude borders on micro-managing the developers. The other extreme is an EA team that is notoriously understaffed, overstretched, and invisible. Here the governance is not rigid but nearly nonexistent. Strangely enough, the consequences of both extremes are so similar that they actually represent two sides of the same coin. A distorted governance—too strict or too weak—leads to a situation where the EA group is not taken seriously and is unable to reach out to its stakeholders and therefore ultimately fails to fulfill its mission.

                If the enterprise architect is completely lost in an everlasting struggle against the entropy of business and technology change, no IT strategy worth its name will ever evolve. This is often the case in a hopelessly understaffed or under-empowered EA organization. The enterprise architect is taken hostage by a business that forever demands solutions right here, right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                To catch up with the pace of business changes, the EA organization is permanently robbing Peter to pay Paul. In such a setup, the EA group does not manage to establish standards that are actually followed within the organization. The enterprise architect is in high demand by the business and the projects to act as the “useful idiot” who can help out in defending technical problems. He is a good-to-have advisor at best and a not-to-have auditor at worst.
            </p>

            The result of distorted governance is usually some kind of anarchy on the ground. Patterns like the Not Invented Here syndrome prevail. Under a weak EA governance, it can be found in all parts of the enterprise, from business over IT department to even the EA group itself. Business departments usually favor custom-tailored solutions over reusing a company-wide platform. IT projects often ignore enterprise standards for technologies and platforms, blaming them as unsuitable for their task at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lack of governance can cause substantial risks, which are usually not recognized by the decision makers. In the case of a global insurance company, for instance, no book of standards was in place for the use of open source components. Every developer basically just downloaded the frameworks needed for his or her task at hand. No legal checks were conducted, not even a centralized systematic tracking of the open source components in use. One simply needs to take a look at the great legal battles around Linux and Hibernate 11 to understand the possible financial implications of such a laissez-faire policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The decisions made by the overstretched and ineffective EA group painted in the Overstrained Technical Advisors are often neither well documented nor properly communicated. The business and IT stakeholders on the field rarely learn about those decisions in the first place. Even if they do get to know them, they hardly understand what analysis has gone into making those decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In such a process, a talented team of architects leaves nothing behind but a pile of architectural models that cannot be adapted, used, or extended, simply because no one outside this expert group understands or appreciates why certain decisions have been made nor the models on which those decisions have been based. What remains is the document graveyard—an archeological evidence of their glorious architectural effort.
