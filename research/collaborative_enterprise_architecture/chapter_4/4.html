            Suppose you are following a perfect diet. You also exercise regularly to keep yourself fit. But still you happen to feel that you are no longer healthy, energetic, enthusiastic, and at ease. What do you do? You will perhaps visit a doctor—a medical practitioner who knows about health matters and whom you would trust the most for her knowledge and expertise in that area. Depending on your income and the graveness of the problem, you will go and see the family doctor next door, or the expensive private specialist in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, despite rigorous adaptation of a comprehensive framework such as TOGAF and significant investment in skill development, enterprises might not see any visible business impact from the effort that has gone into EA. “Are we doing the right things?” they might ask themselves. The benefits are far in the future at best, nonexistent at worst (or so it seems to the enterprises). What do the enterprises do then? They call a “doctor” with vast knowledge and experience. This expert on EA is supposed to be well acquainted with emerging industry trends and competitor initiatives in this field and hence might have better insight into state-of-the-art EA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The established consulting companies (Gartner, Forrester, Accenture, Boston Consulting, Cap Gemini, Deloitte, HP, IBM, McKinsey & Company, and many others) provide such EA experts. Usually they bring their own proprietary approach. This book is not the place to provide a complete overview of all the consulting providers. Instead, we have picked Gartner as one of the more distinguished EA consulting companies and describe their EA framework as a showcase for the complete consulting market.

            Gartner is one of the leading industry research firms in IT. It offers consulting services to corporate customers, especially for their strategic IT management. Enterprise architecture, being strategic in nature, is one of its core research areas. Although Gartner has been actively pursuing enterprise architecture for more than a decade, what it has to offer in this field today essentially stems from the META Group, a consulting firm that Gartner acquired in 2005. The META Group was the market leader by then and a competitor to Gartner.

            Today one would go to Gartner (like any other consulting company) to seek professional advice on enterprise architecture because the firm is recognized as an expert in the field. Gartner helps enterprises embark on their enterprise architecture journey. It does not create enterprise architecture for its customers. Instead, Gartner consultants guide enterprises in setting up a process by which EA can emerge from their business strategy—in other words, Gartner helps to set up an EA practice. In Gartner’s view, enterprise architecture is a verb, not a noun; it is an ongoing process, not an artifact. Gartner defines enterprise architecture as follows (Allega, 2010):
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                [...] the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and improving the key requirements, principles and models that describe the enterprise’s future state and enable its evolution. The scope of the EA includes the people, processes, information and technology of the enterprise, and their relationships to one another and to the external environment. Enterprise architects compose holistic solutions that address the business challenges of the enterprise and support the governance needed to implement them.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gartner does not publish a formal framework or a process to do EA. Gartner analysts often quote: “Just enough enterprise architecture, just in time.” Questions such as what framework or methodology to follow, what taxonomy to use, or what standards to conform to are of least concern and perhaps irrelevant. Nonetheless, what makes Gartner a trusted advisor is perhaps its group of research analysts. The analysts group specializes in EA and operates in close collaboration within Gartner. It carries out applied research and establishes a common knowledge base on varied enterprise architecture topics. Over the years Gartner has been authoritative in analyzing emerging trends, observing adoption patterns, and recommending best practices to its customers in the EA area.
        </p>

            Gartner will approach enterprise architecture with a top-down approach that is highly tailor-made for the business context of its customers. It will further insist that the enterprise architecture must be driven by the enterprise’s top management and with a complete picture of the enterprise in mind. The prime focus for Gartner is always the CEO’s vision and priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Gartner’s view, enterprise architecture is about establishing a shared business vision and strategy for the enterprise. Gartner says that enterprise architecture starts with a vision as to where an organization is going and a strategy as to how to reach there. Any activity that does not address these questions is inconsequential for Gartner. Gartner will typically advise not for delve into the current state architecture for the enterprise. Where the enterprise is today is not important for deciding where it wants to reach in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gartner probably assumes that you can sell off all your old problematic IT stuff in a garage sale and purchase new IT things for a better tomorrow. The effort in enterprise architecture must be focused on strategic concerns rather than the nitty-gritty of today’s operational problems on the ground. They will vanish, or at least become irrelevant in the longer run, if you address them as part of the strategic concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gartner gives overarching importance to two things: establishing a shared vision and bringing all stakeholder groups behind the shared vision with clear, continuous, and consistent communication. To this end, Gartner will first look at the business context of the enterprise, beginning with the CEO’s priorities for the enterprise. It will then help the CEO and CIO to specify the vision for the target state, based on the CEO’s priorities. The contact will be at CxO level, and the dialogue will always be in business language. Gartner will articulate the CEO’s ideas into a common requirements vision (CRV) in such a way that all stakeholder groups will be able to understand exactly what it means for them. The CRV identifies and states the key changes needed to drive CEO vision in the enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, Gartner will start telling the story to stakeholders about where the enterprise is heading and what business drivers it is responding to. This will be a plain story without any prescribed documentation standards, acronyms, or techno-jargon. The only goal is to ensure that the stakeholders understand—and share—a common vision. The Gartner philosophy is as follows: If an organization has a single shared vision for the future and all stakeholders are behind that vision, the organization is already fully equipped to consider the ramifications of the vision into the business, technical, information, and solutions architectures for the enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shared vision dictates changes in all these architectures, assigns priorities to those changes, and relates them to the business value. EA is about bringing together all the stakeholders: the business owners, the information specialists, and the technology implementers. If these three groups can be unified towards a shared vision that drives business value, enterprise architecture will be a success; otherwise, it will be doomed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the shared vision, the Gartner consultants review the business changes with the business sponsor, and the technical or information changes with the CIO or IT owners. At the same time, they make sure to bring everybody together as one team. The success metrics are always expressed in business terms, such as operational profitability, business growth, and customer satisfaction, so that everyone can understand that, too—clearly and precisely.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the last step, Gartner will work with business owners to develop a target business architecture supporting the CEO vision. Subsequently, its consultants will work with the CIO to develop a target information architecture that realizes salient features outlined in the CRV and supports the new business architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            In essence, Gartner, as a strategist or as an advisor, offers thought leadership in the enterprise architecture arena. But to what extent that thought leadership travels from the CEO and CIO office down to the shop floors of business and IT is entirely contingent on the organizational leadership of the enterprise.
