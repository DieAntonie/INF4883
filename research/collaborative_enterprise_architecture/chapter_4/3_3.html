            <h2>TOGAF architecture capability framework</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            TOGAF ADM shows the way (the processes) to do EA, and the Content Framework defines the artifacts that EA should produce. Yet setting up an EA practice is difficult and expensive. It has to deal with a variety of organizational and operational intricacies. The TOGAF 9 Architecture Capability Framework attempts to address this need by providing a set of concepts—from institutions to rule sets and models—for a successful implementation of EA governance. The framework defines the following main concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Architecture board.</strong> The board governs the implementation of the IT strategy. It comprises stakeholders owning the review and maintenance of architecture at two levels. The first one is the global level (organization-wide), and the other is a local one (domain-specific). The board is responsible for reviewing and maintaining architecture with identifiable and stated accountability, and has decision-making authority. The cost for such an architecture board can be justified by preventing ad hoc and unconstrained IT implementations, which, if ignored, would essentially end up in high costs, high risks, lower quality, and difficulty in reuse and replication.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Architecture contract.</strong> The contract is a joint agreement between implementation partners and sponsors regarding the deliverables in terms of quality and fit-for-purpose of the architecture chosen for the implementation. The contract helps to monitor architectural integrity, standards adherence, and risk avoidance in the solution implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Architecture compliance.</strong> The compliance of the solution implementation against the stated architecture contract is vetted through a formal compliance review and decision-making processes. The compliance of projects and implementations is evaluated by two key processes, a project impact assessment at the project start-up, and an architecture compliance review at each key milestone of the project life cycle. The compliance process assesses the adherence7 of a project implementation to the architecture contract or specification, to aid the “go/no-go” decisions for the project execution.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Architecture Maturity Model.</strong> TOGAF 9 proposes an Architecture Maturity Model (ACMM) that tracks the progress and penetration of EA in the enterprise. It was originally developed by the US Department of Commerce. The ACMM is meant to assess the enterprise based on nine EA elements (EA capabilities)8 and then grades the enterprise on a scale of six EA maturity levels. The scorecard derived from a periodic EA maturity assessment process is to be reported to the sponsors and stakeholders of EA. We will discuss maturity models at a little more length in Chapter 5, “EA Maturity Models.”
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Architecture Skills Framework.</strong> Both enterprise architecture and enterprise architect are widely used but poorly defined terms in the industry. Moreover, an EA organization would typically need a variety of skills and many different roles. To address this need, TOGAF 9 proposes that the enterprise must set up an EA practice. This is a formal competency management initiative of skills development and certification by which an enterprise recognizes its architects. That is necessary in order to align the skills available in the enterprise with the architectural activities that the enterprise plans to do. In addition, The Open Group Certified Architect (Open CA) Program devised by The Open Group offers a yardstick to evaluate (and certify) an architect in terms of architectural skills and experience.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The aspects of enterprise architecture management described in the Architecture Capability Framework are interwoven into TOGAF ADM processes as well. For instance, the ADM Phase G is all about Implementation Governance. Phase G includes Architecture Compliance review processes. Another example is that the Statement of Architecture Work created in ADM Phase A is essentially an architecture contract between the architecting organization and the EA sponsor. Likewise, assessment of EA maturity may be a key activity in the Preliminary Phase of ADM.
