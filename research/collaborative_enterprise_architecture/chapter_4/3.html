        </header>
        <p>
            If Zachman is a framework of elements providing the constituents of enterprise architecture, TOGAF is a recipe that tells how to build up those constituentsâ€”the work products of EA.
        </p>
        <p>
            TOGAF is a generic yet comprehensive methodological framework for developing enterprise architectures. It is owned by The Open Group consortium and free for your own use within the enterprise. As The Open Group states, TOGAF is the codified common sense for enterprise architecture management. It has been developed based on the experience of EA experts and practitioners for a decade or more. TOGAF can be applied across industries. It is agnostic to the technology in use. Moreover, it is equipped with a vast knowledge base - both in terms of online literature and community support.
        </p>
        <p>
            TOGAF 9.1, the current version at the time of this writing5 (The Open Group, 2011), has five basic parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Architecture Development Methodology (ADM)
            </li>
            <li>
                Architecture Content Framework
            </li>
            <li>
                Architecture Capability Framework
            </li>
            <li>
                Enterprise Continuum and Tools
            </li>
            <li>
                Reference Models
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For the sake of brevity, we will look at only the first three parts of TOGAF. They are most relevant to the scope of this book.
