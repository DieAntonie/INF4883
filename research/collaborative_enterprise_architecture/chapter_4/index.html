            <h2>EA Frameworks</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            There have been many misconceptions about EA in the minds of IT practitioners, IT managers, and even seasoned IT architects themselves. For instance:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>EA = Zachman Framework?</strong> You attend a one-day seminar on Zachman Framework and join the elite club of enterprise architects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>EA = TOGAF?</strong> You attend a five-day training and certification course on TOGAF and then roll up your sleeves to “do enterprise architecture” the very next day.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>EA = Gartner?</strong> You consult an expert from Gartner or Forrester, then do what they tell you to do in EA. If you do this well, all sins, misdoings, and agonies related to your IT will disappear.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These statements may sound a little exaggerated. Nonetheless, we have heard undertones of them on several occasions—sometimes in our formal business meetings with customers, sometimes while listening to presentations in conferences, and sometimes even in informal chat with our peers walking down our office corridors. Moreover, such misconceptions seem to be more prevalent where non-IT people have ended up managing IT. EA has always been cursed with gross generalization and oversimplification. Perhaps it’s due to the widespread ignorance about this field that such myths become popular.
        </p>

            Zachman, TOGAF, and Gartner (amongst many others) are undoubtedly good resources on the subject of enterprise architecture. They are early explorers and trendsetters that have survived the test of time. These frameworks are meant to help you bring order to your chaotic enterprise IT landscape. To that effect, they give a direction for your thinking about enterprise architecture. They also provide best practices, tips, and techniques for doing EA in your business. But that is as far as they will go. They do not guarantee success. Using these frameworks ultimately boils down to what you can actually do (or need to do) in EA for your enterprise and how well you can relate your EA effort to what the frameworks have to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
            It thus becomes necessary to understand what Zachman, TOGAF, and Gartner imply from a practical standpoint: what they are, what they are expected to do, and what they are not expected to do. At the onset, we want to clarify that none of them can be a silver bullet for your enterprise architecture initiative. They are no all-in-one cure for the miseries and pains of your business-IT environment, either.

            The following sections give a brief overview of these frameworks and their relevance for practical use. To begin with, let’s first look at what the term EA framework really means.
