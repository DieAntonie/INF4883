            <h2>TOGAF architecture content framework</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            ADM provides a description of what needs to be done—the process to create an architecture. In contrast, the Architecture Content Framework, introduced in TOGAF 9, describes what it should look like in the end—the work product. The Content Framework offers a consistent and structured way to present architectural work products. It acts as a companion to ADM as it standardizes the inputs and outputs of ADM processes. There is a clear map from the content framework to the TOGAF ADM processes. In addition, it also makes it easy to reference and classify architectural work products. This way, it makes the complementary use of the Zachman Framework obsolete.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Content Framework is a significant addition to TOGAF 9. It provides a Content META Model (an information model for the actual architectural models and views) as well as a classification schema to categorize and organize your architectural work products.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Content META Model defines the elements that constitute the enterprise architecture. It further differentiates the elements as core (the ones that are mandatory for architectural description) and extensions (which may be used optionally). This gives room to adapt or extend your own content META model as the situation may demand. Figure 4-5 shows an overview of the entities in the framework; Figure 4-6 depicts the entity-relationship diagram for the Content META Model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The content framework uses three categories to describe a work product (i.e., the output or input of an architectural activity):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Deliverables. These are the formal work products created by the projects and are contractually binding. Deliverables can contain many artifacts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Artifacts. Artifacts are fine-grained work products that describe architecture from a specific viewpoint. These include architectural requirements, use-case specifications, class diagrams, network diagrams, or any sort of architecture models. Artifacts are further classified into catalogues (lists of things), matrices (relationships and dependencies between things), and diagrams (visual depiction of things). The collection of all artifacts makes up your architecture repository.
            </li>
            <li>
                Building blocks. These are the packages of functionality defined to meet certain business needs, published through a standard interface and available for enterprise-wide consumption. They are interoperable, reusable, and replaceable across the organization. In a way, building blocks are nothing but the connotation of well-established architectural concepts such as services (as in SOA) and capabilities. Building blocks are further classified into architectural building blocks (ABB, the ones that are technology-aware) and solution building blocks (SBB, those that are product- or vendor-aware). The building blocks can be combined to deliver architectures and solutions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The work products, such as catalogues, matrices, and diagrams, are nothing but different viewpoints derived from the architectural elements in the META model. These viewpoints are shown in Figure 4-7.
