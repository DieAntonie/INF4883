            <h2>What is an EA framework?</h2>
        </header>
            <p>
                An EA framework is a set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of looking at enterprise reality via views on (architectural) models. It offers a fundamental structure, serving as a scaffold for developing, maintaining, and using EA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the last 25 years, a number of enterprise architecture frameworks have come and gone. These frameworks have originated from different sources and have been applied in different contexts. Philip Allega, research analyst at Gartner, highlights an overwhelming proliferation of EA frameworks with a bit of frustration. In a blog entry titled “My Mother has an EA Definition, too,” he commented on the introduction of a new EA definition by the Enterprise Architecture Research Forum (EARF), South Africa, in August 2010:
            </p>
            <p>
                <blockquote>
                    If they’d only add a framework/approach to this definition I could notch my list of EA frameworks/approaches I’m tracking up by one (note: if you’re curious, I’m at 77 right now and if you’ve got one, please let me know). For those of you who aren’t used to reading with a sarcastic voice, please try using sarcasm when you say (out loud): The world really needs yet another definition of enterprise architecture &lt;large, tired, shoulder shrugging sigh&gt;
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                The true number of EA frameworks depends on what you count as a “framework”, but there is definitely an abundance of them. Moreover, they are quite different from each other. For instance, the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architectures and The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) have hardly anything common between them except two words: architecture and framework. TOGAF, in fact, acknowledges Zachman as a complementing framework, which implies that TOGAF and Zachman indeed have only minimal overlap.
            </p>
            <p>
                We cannot cover all the frameworks (or approaches, or methods—whatever you call them) that are out there.2 We will not assess, compare, nor endorse any of them, either. For the sake of brevity, we will simply have a quick glance at the methods we listed in the introduction:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architectures
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gartner Methodology (formerly META Framework)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We have selected each of them intentionally:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Zachman</strong>, because it is one of the first explorations in EA;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>TOGAF</strong>, since it is an open EA framework; in our context, “open” means industry-agnostic, vendor-neutral, and community-based;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gartner</strong>, because it is one of the many recognized consulting firms for EA in the corporate world.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Of course, these frameworks are not the only ones that constitute the EA body of knowledge, as pointed out earlier. We do not intend to endorse these three frameworks as the best ones. However, these three are de facto among the most widely known approaches today. This is perhaps due to their versatility, visibility, and market impact so far.

                EA has also received significant attention from academia, consulting firms, and governments. A number of academic institutions offer research briefings and learning programs regarding EA approaches and practices. They have been quite active and visible with their research on various EA topics in the last five years. Just to name a few prominent examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Center for Information Systems Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CISR–MIT), United States. The focus of CISR–MIT is on developing enterprise architecture as a strategy based on their extensive industry research.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Software Engineering for Business Information Systems (sebis), TU Mu¨nchen, Germany. Sebis concentrates on developing EA patterns (as opposed to frameworks) and evaluating EA management tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Center for Enterprise Architecture, Pennsylvania State University, United States. The focus of the college is on curriculum formalization, competency development, and advanced research in the EA area.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition, many established IT consulting firms, such as Accenture, Boston Consulting, Cap Gemini, Deloitte, Forrester, Gartner, HP, IBM, McKinsey & Company, and others, usually have their own EA approaches or methods (proprietary frameworks, so to speak) that they use while performing EA activities for their clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we should mention the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). It is the enterprise architecture for the largest and most complex enterprise on Earth: the US federal government. Although FEA has been available only since 2006, its history dates back to 1996, when the US Congress passed a bill known as the Clinger Cohen Act.3 This bill mandates that all government agencies take steps to improve the effectiveness of their IT investments. FEA enables them to do that. The US government is one of the most serious adopters of enterprise architecture. The claim can be made that no enterprise has spent more money in EA than what has gone into FEA to date

                Is there hope that this zoo of frameworks will disappears in the future and give room to only a few best-in-class frameworks? The answer to this question is tricky—maybe or maybe not. The main reasons for this state of affairs are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>EA is perceived as an enterprise-specific initiative.</strong> It has a strong dependency on the way the enterprise operates. A number of enterprise-specific factors, such as business imperatives, organizational structure, work culture, and political dynamics, may have significant influence on the modus operandi of an EA organization. This makes it difficult to define a one-size-fits-all framework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>EA research is not proceeding as fast as one could wish.</strong> The field of EA is still young and immature. It may traverse different paths before it will ultimately stabilize as a mature discipline. The rapid changes in the business and IT world, coupled with difficulties in recognizing the value of EA (in terms of cost/benefit and return on investment), might be the key reasons for EA not being able to progress faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>EA frameworks fail to strike a balance.</strong> Some EA frameworks are too generic. They tend to become too abstract and academic to deliver any tangible outcome. Other frameworks are overly specific. They tend to become too exhaustive and complex to be put into practice in a meaningful way. For instance, the Zachman Framework shows a tendency to fall into the first category (too generic), whereas the FEA leans toward the second category (overly specific). What is really needed is a way to strike a difficult balance between too much and not enough detail. In this respect, there is a wide chasm between the current ways of performing EA.
