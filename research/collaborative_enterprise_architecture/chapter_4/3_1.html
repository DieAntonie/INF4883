            <h2>TOGAF architecture development methodology (ADM)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The most significant component of TOGAF is the Architecture Development Methodology (ADM). It essentially defines a full life-cycle process for planning, designing, realizing, and governing enterprise architecture. TOGAF ADM has a genetic resemblance to the traditional waterfall software development model. This model typically consists of phases such as planning, analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment, organized in sequential order (Figure 4-2). Each phase in the waterfall software development life cycle (SDLC) can be fully described by entry criteria, tasks, verification, and exit criteria. TOGAF ADM adopts a similar approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            ADM consists of eight phases A to H, and a Preliminary one at the start (Figure 4-3). Each phase is fully described using an objectives–approach–inputs–steps–outputs pattern, akin to the waterfall model. The phases will be executed from A to H, normally in sequential order.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there are fundamental differences between the waterfall SDLC and TOGAF ADM. In general, software development projects are short-lived. They are scheduled for a fixed time and have a budget for a limited effort. They have a clear beginning (project funding) and end (system deployment and maintenance transition).
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, EA is a continuous journey for the enterprise in a search for a better tomorrow. So, what TOGAF does is to simply tie the last phase (H) of an ADM cycle to the first phase (A) of the next cycle. This way ADM becomes an iterative, repeatable, and continuous process for the enterprises to follow. As a consequence, the funding model and the engagement model for TOGAF (the EA group in the enterprise) must be apportioned accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            As another difference, in waterfall SDLC the requirement analysis phase is typically executed during the early part of the project life cycle. In contrast, TOGAF ADM has a Requirements Management part that always stays at the heart of the process. All ADM phases (A–H) are closely tied to this part. Focus and effort during all phases are derived from, and lead to, the core Requirements Management process
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also a few practical aspects that TOGAF ADM has to tackle. For instance, for most enterprises it is unrealistic to assume that the architectural initiative starts on a green field and that the ADM Phase A (Architecture Vision) will be the first step. The enterprises would typically have many ongoing or past initiatives that involve architectural development efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, architectural activities in the enterprise cannot follow a strictly linear, sequential, and step-by-step procedure the way that TOGAF ADM advocates. More likely, these activities take place in a random and chaotic manner. Sometimes they even happen parallel to each other, depending on the organizational, operational, or implementational priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            TOGAF recognizes this situation and flexes its muscles to adapt to it, at least to some extent. First, it allows you to begin with any of the ADM phases in between. Furthermore, it is permitted to iterate over a part of the ADM cycle that can be logically demarcated, as indicated in Figure 4-4. ADM supports iterations in many ways, the two most important ones being:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Iteration through the entire ADM cycle (phases A–H)
            </li>
            <li>
                Iteration through cycles covering one or more phases (architecture context iteration, architecture definition iteration, transition planning iteration, architecture governance iteration), as shown in Figure 4-4
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition, ADM can be custom-tailored with regard to the scope (width) and level of detail (depth) of work to be taken up in one iteration, to suit the given circumstances and constraints in your organization. In essence, although it appears at first sight to adhere to a strict waterfall pattern, TOGAF ADM is surprisingly flexible. It allows phases to be reorganized, reordered, combined, or performed partially, if that fits the need of the enterprise. It is also possible to jump back from any point to any other point within an iteration. The only constraint is that all intermediate steps between the two points must be carried out again.
        </p>
        <p>
            TOGAF, from version 9 onward, has a new module called ADM Guidelines and Techniques. It provides specific guidelines about the adaptation of the ADM process in your particular enterprise environment. It also offers certain techniques for formalizing your architecture development and management.
        </p>
        <p>
            To sum up, TOGAF ADM brings discipline to the architecture development process. It promotes a sense of consistency and repeatability while offering amazing flexibility. We have seen these qualities as being critical in practice when dealing with the management of any large-scale endeavor like EA. We will return to these aspects of TOGAF ADM in Chapter 7, “Towards Pragmatism: Lean and Agile EA.” As we will see there, TOGAF can be reconciled in a quite natural way with the flexibility of a lean and agile EA approach.
