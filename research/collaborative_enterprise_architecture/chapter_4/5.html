            <h2>The role and use of EA frameworks</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            At Bank4Us, Dave Callaghan, the CIO, had asked one of the expensive, exclusive consulting companies to advise him on the appropriate EA strategy for his company. That was two years ago. As a result of this engagement, the EA team was reorganized and enlarged. In addition, Dave—in need of someone driving EA further—managed to entice the head consultant away from this company, and appointed him as head of the EA team. This is how Oscar Salgado, now the chief architect, joined Bank4Us.

        <p>
            Due to his background in management and strategy consulting, Oscar is a firm believer in corporate visions and full-scale EA frameworks that allow translating the board’s business maxims into practical action. Before he took over the EA team, the enterprise architects had not seriously used any formal methodology. Oscar introduced TOGAF, in combination with the Zachman framework, for classifying the architecture artifacts. He sent his architects to a one-week top-notch training, and stubbornly insisted on his team sticking to this new methodology.

        <p>
            Since then, Oscar has seen some benefits of adhering to the TOGAF framework. Undoubtedly, it has given the less capable architects within his team a sense of direction, like a railing protecting them from straying too far from the target. But he has also heard complaints from others—often the top performers in his team—that since the introduction of TOGAF the number of documents to be written has increased even more, and the target readership has less and less time to read them. Oscar Salgado is realist enough to recognize some truth in this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ian Miller, in charge of the Closer to Customer IT transformation and reporting to Oscar, was one of the early TOGAF adopters in the team. Ian is skeptical by nature, which makes him a bit wary of highflying methodologies in general. Being a well-known enterprise architect at Bank4Us, Ian is often asked for his opinion about using Zachman or TOGAF in his work. If he is honest, he does not have any shining success stories, and might even not see them in future. His main criticism is that it is difficult to show a step-by-step use of a framework in a real-life scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
            But besides a skeptic, Ian is also a pragmatist. This is why he regards EA frameworks as a set of practices suggested by the experts and practitioners in this field. It is an orderly collection of codified common sense, best practices, and lessons learnt from the past experiences. For Ian, TOGAF is like a toolkit containing many tools and the techniques to use those tools. He has decided for himself that he will use only the tools that are fit for his purpose at hand. He uses them by having learned the right techniques to use them. For Ian, it is the same thing as when he is at home, building a bookshelf for his son. If he needs to use a screwdriver, he takes the screwdriver from this toolkit. If he does not need the hammer, he will not even take it out. Nevertheless, he has to know all tools in his box, so that he can use the appropriate one to do right things at the right time for the right purpose.

            How can you apply Ian’s pragmatic toolbox approach to your own EA work? We will look at some new ways of doing this effectively in “Chapter 7 Making EA Pragmatic: Lean and Agile EA”. We will introduce the notion of Architecture Factory and introduce lean and agile ways of doing enterprise architecture. By innovatively incorporating the principles and practices from the Lean (as in manufacturing and software engineering) and the Agile methodology (as in software engineering) to the world of EA, we will sketch as to how a comprehensive EA framework like TOGAF can be leveraged in your own EA—selectively, flexibly, and pragmatically.
