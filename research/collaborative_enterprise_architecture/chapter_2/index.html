            <h2>What Is Enterprise Architecture?</h2>

        <p>
            Enterprise architecture (EA) comes with a promise: simplify IT. The problem it is tackling here is about controlling the complexity and cost of IT while enabling the desired change and competitiveness for the business. The term enterprise architecture, in this context, appears to be self-explanatory: Apply architectural thinking to simplify the management of a complex enterprise IT landscape. There indeed are many experts who define EA along this line. Others take their own stance as to what EA means for their enterprises, given the business needs, the position of IT, and the political culture in their enterprises.

        <p>
            All these definitions are valid, since they provide a basis against which enterprises can scope and judge their own EA initiatives. Yet there is no consensus definition for EA today—even after 25 years of its existence. There are more fundamental truths about EA that cannot be encapsulated in a single definition. This chapter is our attempt to explore these truths.

            We’ll first look at the basic meaning of the term architecture. Then we will analyze what the term means when it’s applied to describing or managing a complex system such as an enterprise.
