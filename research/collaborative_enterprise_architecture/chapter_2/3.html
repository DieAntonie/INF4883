            <h2>EA applicability and use</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Today most large and midsize organizations across all industry sectors embrace EA as an authoritative entity having its own budget, headcount, processes, and organizational structure. EA is specifically predominant in companies with a decentralized organization and a distributed operational environment, where an enterprise-wide shared vision and an integrated strategic plan are the key imperatives for business success.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way in which EA is approached is, however, specific to the context and scope within which the enterprise operates. A bank operates in a different fashion than a car manufacturer. Within the financial services industry, a retail bank does not work like an investment bank. Even within a retail bank there may be major differences between regions or market segments. In each case, EA is approached differently, but it always has a common purpose and theme: EA enables an understanding of the structure and behavior of the enterprise business and IT from a holistic viewpoint. It also provides a strategic approach to evolving the enterprise IT landscape. In that way, EA can deal with the complexity of its environment and manage the change in the enterprise’s IT landscape and business environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            EA can be applied to scopes other than the enterprise IT landscape alone. It has a valid use case in any of the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Managing the business operation and the IT landscape of large and midsize enterprises
            </li>
            <li>
                Managing business and IT for a sufficiently complex subdomain of an enterprise
            </li>
            <li>
                Managing large-scale, IT-enabled business transformations in the enterprise
            </li>
            <li>
                Managing the product life cycle of a software product company
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In many large companies, the term EA is applied to cases where the “enterprise” is not the entire company but just a sufficiently complex subdomain of the main enterprise. The business-IT ecosystem owned by a subdomain can already be complex enough to demand a dedicated EA focus for itself. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A line of business for a large bank—for instance, the retail-banking division with a country-wide network of 5,000 branches in a distributed operating environment
            </li>
            <li>
                Customer services of a telecom operator with more than 300 CRM applications across four business lines
            </li>
            <li>
                The regional operating unit of a manufacturer in Europe
            </li>
            <li>
                A unified web portal platform of an insurance firm that supports three business lines and five regional segments
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To elaborate further, let’s consider a global car manufacturing enterprise. The complexity of its information systems is enormous, ranging from human resources applications over marketing and finance up to supply chain management and computer-aided manufacturing systems. This complexity results from the multitude of business functions and operations at a global scale. Moreover, the enterprise typically is a merger of several companies producing different brands. This implies a great deal of diversity in business strategies, principles, and goals among different sub-domains of the enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the business is distributed all over the world and has to comply with the legal, cultural, and business stipulations in each country. Recently, many enterprises with distributed business operations and decentralized organizations have tried to leverage synergies across their business units, market segments, or geographic regions. These enterprises have engaged in large-scale, cross-organizational, IT-enabled business transformation initiatives. IT is placed at the core of business success by such initiatives. Their promise is to deliver tangible business benefits in terms of cost reduction, operational excellence, customer satisfaction, or product innovation. Such programs involve harmonization of significant parts of the business processes in different business units and system integration across data centers. Even if the scope is not the whole enterprise, EA is still required in such initiatives, since we need to instill a shared vision and a structured approach while managing the complexity involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s conclude by looking at software vendors such as Oracle, IBM, or Microsoft. From their perspective, EA usually does not involve dealing with their own supporting IT infrastructure but with the envisioning, roadmap creation, and release planning of their software products and platforms. EA in this context is employed to strategically manage the roadmaps and release plans for vendors’ software products and platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            EA has a role to play whenever one plans to do anything that spans many applications, projects, business units, geographical regions, or market segments. It comprises methodology and taxonomy to deal with certain problems and demands in the strategic management of business and IT. In the next chapter, we will take a closer look at how an enterprise architect uses these tools to fulfill her mission.
