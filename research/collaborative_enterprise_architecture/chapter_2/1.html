            <h2>The meaning of architecture</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            There is a widely used definition of architecture for software-intensive systems in the ANSI/IEEE standard 1471-2000 (IEEE Computer Society, 2000):
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Architecture is essentially meant to establish the structural foundation, behavioral characteristics, and principles that guide the creation, evolution, and operation of a system in the long run. In that way, architecture provides up-front knowledge about commonly accepted constraints and freedoms in the long-term design of the system and its constituent parts. It identifies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What in the system forms a stable foundation and hence is hard to change later on
            </li>
            <li>
                What else can remain dynamic and flexible in the long run
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The architecture, or rather certain parts of the architecture documentation, is also meant to act as a basis to communicate the system knowledge to its stakeholders. The system stakeholders are the people who deal with creation, evolution, and operation of the system. There are many of them; for instance:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The owner who pays for it
            </li>
            <li>
                The strategist who conceptualizes it
            </li>
            <li>
                The planner who plans its creation
            </li>
            <li>
                The designer who designs it
            </li>
            <li>
                The implementer who builds it
            </li>
            <li>
                The subcontractor who provides constituent parts for it
            </li>
            <li>
                The field support staff who maintains or operates it in the field
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these stakeholders looks at the system with her own viewpoint and cares only about her specific interests and concerns. For instance, the owner is interested in functional features and usage convenience, whereas the implementer mainly cares for technology environment, design specifications, and construction process. The stakeholders need to know about the system in the language they understand. The architecture serves this purpose by providing distinct views of the system, each view addressing the specific interest or concern of a specific stakeholder group. As a whole, the architecture may be used to view a broad outline or a detailed feature of the system, depending on who is looking at it and what is being looked at.

                    <strong>The Definition of Architecture</strong>
                </p>
            </header>
            <p>
                Architecture is the representation of the structure and behavior of a system and its constituent parts, plus a set of principles that guide the systemâ€™s long-term evolution.

            As the scale and complexity in a system grows, the need for proper planning in designing, building, and operating it becomes more and more important. Likewise, as stakeholder involvement in the system increases, the need for their shared understanding becomes crucial. Architectural thinking addresses these two key imperatives of managing complex systems. A small, simple, unilateral system, like the wooden birdhouse in Figure 2-1, does not require extensive architectural thinking, but larger and more complex structures do.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following key characteristics of architectural thinking help us understand and manage a complex system:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Modeling.</strong> Modeling provides an abstraction of a complex system for the purpose of understanding it before building or changing it. Abstraction reveals a small amount of important things that can be dealt with at one time. This allows a selective examination of certain aspects of a system. Abstraction permits us to manage complexity and deal with essentials while ignoring inconsequential details.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Visualization.</strong> Visualization is the depiction of the architecture model of a complex system, preferably using a formalized and precise notation. This serves the purpose of verifying that the model satisfies key requirements of the system. It also allows blocking out certain alternatives and making prerequisite decisions before creating or changing the actual system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Communication.</strong> The architecture models and viewpoints provide a mechanism via which to communicate knowledge about the system among system stakeholders, using a common vocabulary. The stakeholders can visualize the system in a way they can understand and act on. This enables them to mock up usage scenarios. Such scenarios imitate some or all of the external behaviors of the system in a consistent manner and in accordance with the interests and concerns of respective stakeholders.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This generic notion of architecture is applicable in many engineering practices, especially traditional civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering disciplines. It fits well for building and construction of houses or manufacturing cars. It has also been generally accepted in the world of computers. Hardware architecture, network architecture, and software architecture are predominantly used to define IT systems. But enterprise architecture goes beyond IT systems and pure technology.
