            <h2>Applying architecture to an enterprise</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            March and Simon (1958) define enterprises as complex systems comprising individuals or groups that coordinate actions in pursuit of common goals. During the late 1980s, John Zachman (1987) applied the notion of architecture to represent the functioning of an enterprise, specifically within the context of the enterprise IT landscape and the business environment. Therefore, the primary scope for the term enterprise in this book is reduced to the enterprise IT landscape plus its relationship with the business environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enterprise architecture (EA), then, is loosely defined as the architecture of a system where the system is the whole enterprise. Figure 2-2, using an analogy with city planning, illustrates the core concept behind EA.

                Enterprise architecture (EA) is the representation of the structure and behavior of an enterprise’s IT landscape in relation to its business environment. It reflects the current and future use of IT in the enterprise and provides a roadmap to reach a future state. EA offers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An insight into the current utilization of IT in business operations,
                </li>
                <li>
                    A vision for the future utilization of IT in business operations, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    A roadmap for the evolution of the IT landscape from the current state to a future state, along with the transient states in between.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <p>
            EA is documented using architecture artifacts such as model diagrams and principles. These are collectively referred to as the architecture blueprint.

                <h4>ARCHITECTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS-IT MANAGEMENT IN AN ENTERPRISE</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Is Enterprise Architecture Management?</strong>
                </p>
            </header>
            <p>
                Enterprise architecture management (EAM) is a structured approach that an enterprise uses for creating, managing, and using enterprise architecture to align business and IT. EAM translates the enterprise vision into venture and takes the enterprise through the journey from its current state to the target state.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this book, we use the term EA as a synonym for both EA and EAM, since in practice the two concepts are inseparable.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            It must be noted that EA does not stand alone in its pursuit of managing the complexities of the enterprise IT landscape. Apart from pure EA, the role of an enterprise architect extends into the realms of other IT management practices as well, especially in strategic enterprise planning, IT investment management, IT project management, and IT infrastructure management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Figure 2-3 shows that EA describes a clear line of sight from strategic goals through project investments to measurable business value and performance improvements—for the entire enterprise or for a part of the enterprise. EA helps organize and illuminate the relationships among the enterprise’s strategic goals, investments, business solutions, and measurable performance indicators.
        </p>
        <p>
            EA is however just one link in a lattice of integrated IT practice areas. Other practice areas, such as strategic planning, investment management, project management, and infrastructure management, must be equally strong and fully integrated with the EA practice. Only through such integration can EA provide a stable foundation for sound IT management practices, end-to-end governance of IT investments, and alignment of IT implementation with the enterprise’s vision and strategic goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one more fundamental distinction of EA that should be noted here. In contrast to the traditional architecture practices, which primarily look at pure technical systems such as a bridge, a car, or a plane, EA deals with a socio-technical system. This difference is like the difference between a house and a home. A house is a mere structure that provides shelter; a home is a place where a family lives. The people element brings complex behavioral attributes into the functioning of an enterprise in the same way as it turns a house into a home. Hence, the term architecture does not literally apply to the enterprise in the same way as it has been traditionally applied to technical systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this book, an enterprise is characterized as an organization of people who use (among other things) IT to do business. In that sense, enterprise architecture not only deals with technical aspects such as IT systems and infrastructure, but it also deals with social elements such as collaborative business processes, organizational leadership, political dynamics, and work culture in the enterprise. This fact carries great consequences for the way EA should be looked at and dealt with. We will elaborate this concept in greater detail in Chapter 6, in the section “Reflection on Complexity.”
