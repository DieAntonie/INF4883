            <h2>Positioning Enterprise Architecture</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            In the previous chapter, we have discussed the needs for enterprise architecture. This chapter is concerned with enterprise architecture as a means to meet these needs. We will start this chapter with a historical perspective on the concept of architecture as a means of obtaining insight into, as well as harnessing, complexity. To gain a better insight into the role of enterprise architecture in governing transformations, Sect. 3.2 will then discuss the governance paradigm and relate this to the role of enterprise architecture. Based on this discussion, Sect. 3.3 then continues by identifying seven possible applications of enterprise architecture from a governance perspective. Using this as a context, Sect. 3.4 provides a discussion of several definitions of enterprise architecture, while also providing the definition of enterprise architecture as used in this book. To make this definition more specific and tangible, Sect. 3.5 will discuss the key concepts underlying enterprise architecture, while Sect. 3.6 will highlight the benefits of enterprise architecture in relation to the needs identified in the previous chapter. Finally, Sect. 3.7 takes a first brief look at the competencies needed from the architect.

                <h3>3.1 A Historical Perspective on Enterprise Architecture</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The recorded history of classical architecting began more than 4,000 years ago in Egypt with the erection of the pyramids, the complexity of which had been overwhelming designers and builders alike [82, 113]. This complexity had at its roots in the phenomenon that as systems became increasingly more ambitious, the number of interrelationships among the elements increased far faster than the number of elements themselves. Pyramids were no longer simple burial sites; they had to be demonstrations of political and religious power, secure repositories of god-like rulers and their wealth, and impressive engineering accomplishments. Each of demands, in itself, already required major resources. The complex interrelationships among combined elements were well beyond what the traditional tools of the engineers and builders could handle. This led to the introduction of architecture as a means to obtain and maintain insight into these complex relationships. We have remained doing so. Following the evolution of our societies, we have used architecture as a means of obtaining insight and harnessing complexity of a wide variety of constructs as illustrated in Fig. 3.1.
            </p>
            <p>
                After years of architecture in the physical world, the term has also taken a foothold in the field of IT. Architecture is well known from the world of construction. Therefore, some 20 years ago, the IT industry became confronted with complex structures and decision, a comparison with the construction industry seemed an obvious one. Probably the first person to use the term architecture in this context was Blaauw [6]: “The term architecture is used here to describe the attributes of a system as seen by the programmer, i.e., the conceptual structure and functional behavior, as distinct from the organization of the data flow and controls, the logical design, and the physical implementation.” Blaauw was the codeveloper of the IBM 360 computer family in the 1960s. In his publications, he refers to the architecture (i.e., design) of computers, while discussing such topics as modularity, reliability, and consistency. At about the same time, Dijkstra started his work on structured programming. Although he did not use the word architecture, he repeatedly underlined the importance of the structure of software, thus laying certain foundations for architecture. This comparison leads to terms such as software engineering and structured programming. At that time, this comparison brought a degree of order into many aspects of the creation of these programs as advocated by Parnas [100].
            </p>
            <p>
                When software applications became larger and larger, people such as Shaw and Garlan coined the term software architecture [123]. This notion of architecture deals with the key design principles underlying software artefacts. In the 1980s and 1990s, people became aware that the development of information technology (IT) should be done in conjunction with the development of the context in which it was used. This led to the identification of the so-called business/IT alignment problem [55, 99, 135]. Solving the business/IT alignment problem requires enterprises to align human, organizational, informational, and technological aspects of systems. Quite early on, the term architecture was also introduced as a means to further alignment, and thus analyzes and solves business/IT alignment problems [21, 135, 155]. Recently, the awareness emerged that alignment between business and IT is not enough; there are many more aspects in the enterprise in need of alignment. This has led to the use of the term architecture at the enterprise level: enterprise architecture [18, 20, 37, 78].

                <h3>3.2 Governance Paradigm</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                According to [1], governance is “the activity of [] controlling a company or an organization” or in other words, the supervision of the compliance of rules. In our view, enterprise architecting is an integral part of the governance of an enterprise and its transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally, an enterprise architecture plays a pivotal role in the continuous improvement process of an enterprise. In order to better understand the governing role of enterprise architecture, this section offers a discussion of the governance paradigm [79], and consequently applies it to an enterprise transformation context. Figure 3.2, which is based on [79], depicts the basic governance paradigm. The governance paradigm involves three important assumptions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    there is some system,1 the target system, which interacts with its environment;
                </li>
                <li>
                    this target system needs to be governed;
                </li>
                <li>
                    there is another system, the governing system which does the actual governing.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The essence of the governance paradigm is that during the realization of a process there is some kind of interaction with the environment (input and output), and that this process is controlled by some (internal) authority which monitors, and if necessary adjusts, the process to make sure the intended objectives are reached. This authority is called governing system (GS).2 The system governed by the GS is referred to as the target system (TS). Since an organization is part of a larger system, the GS also interacts with the environment to determine which services of products to deliver, to determine new opportunities and to determine changes in the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of enterprise architecting, the target system that needs governing is the transformation process of the enterprise, where not-transforming, i.e., maintaining a status quo is considered as a special transformation process. The latter case may actually take more effort than one would expect. Maintaining a status quo requires activities preventing erosion of an existing structure. Taking the enterprise as the target system, leads to the situation as depicted in Fig. 3.3. In an operational enterprise, a distinction is made between a target system comprising the operational processes and a governing system, which governs these operational processes. The operational enterprise is transformed (to better meet the challenges and opportunities posed by its environment) by an enterprise transformation system. This transformation system is comprised of a transformation governing system and the actual transformation process(es). These latter processes constitute the target of the transformation governing system.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, enterprise architecting should be regarded as being a part of the governance of the enterprise transformation. Figure 3.4, therefore, shows a refined view on the governance of an enterprise’s transformation processes involving three subdomains: strategy, architecture, and program management [116].
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the requirements on enterprise architecture as a means, as discussed in the previous chapter, enterprise architecting can be likened to the use of a “dashboard” which allows the architect and stakeholders to steer the enterprise’s transformation processes. When using the dashboard as a metaphor, the “dashboard” displays the enterprise architecture in terms of relevant aspects of the current state of the enterprise, its future direction, and the desired states of the enterprise. Just as the selected/displayed speed, altitude, and direction of an airplane is not the dashboard, but rather displayed on the dashboard, the dashboard is not the enterprise architecture. Analogously, it is the enterprise architecture, or rather a part thereof, what will be displayed on the dashboard. In addition, the dashboard may contain a report on the gaps between the current state and desired states, as well as its operational performance in terms of its current state.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an airplane, a “dashboard” comprises of indicators (meters, lights, etc.) and controls (levers, handles, pedals, and knobs). In the case of enterprise architecture as a means to govern transformations, the dashboard needs at least:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Indicators</strong> giving insight into:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            the enterprise’s current state,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the enterprise’s future state,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the enterprise’s current performance,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the enterprise’s future (expected) performance,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the direction and progress of its transformation processes,
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Controls</strong> allowing the transformation processes to be influenced.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The indicators may take the form of models, views, performance measurements, etc. The controls may take the form of (enforced) reference models, design principles, standards, etc. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.5. The process of measuring, providing insight, decision-making, and directing the enterprise’s transformation process is a continuous (and far from linear) process. Based on the insights provided by from the dashboard, the stakeholders in conjunction with the architect may decide to adjust the directions as set out on the dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation depicted in Fig. 3.5 is still somewhat naive in the sense that it takes a rather reactive perspective. If the architect and stakeholders would have some kind of a predictive model, which predicts future properties of the enterprise, the transformation processes, and their environment (ecosystem), then this model can be used to more proactively steer the transformation process of the enterprise. This leads to the situation as shown in Fig. 3.6. Using a model of possible target systems, the enterprise system and the ecosystem in which they operate, what-if analysis can be conducted based upon which the actual transformation processes can be directed more proactively. This essentially leads to an experimentation environment with a shadow dashboard and shadow (eco)system. This experimentation environment will provide the stakeholder with insight in the impact of change, based on different scenarios.

                <h3>3.3 Key Applications for Enterprise Architecture</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Based on the needs and challenges of enterprises as discussed in the previous chapter (in particular, Sect. 2.6), we identify seven key applications for enterprise architecture as a means. In combination, these applications provide an instrument to make informed decisions as well as to ensure compliance of the transformation to these decisions, at several levels of specificity:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <header>
                        <h4>Situation description</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Use enterprise architecture as a means for goal/cause analysis to investigate problems/shortcomings in an existing situation. This also involves the creation of a shared (among stakeholders) understanding of the existing situation.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <header>
                        <h4>Strategic direction</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Use enterprise architecture to express (and motivate) the future direction of an enterprise, as well as investigate (and evaluate) different alternatives. This also involves the creation of a shared (among stakeholders) conceptualization of the (possible) future directions, and shared agreement for the selected alternative.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <header>
                        <h4>Gap analysis</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Use enterprise architecture to identify key problems, challenges, issues, impediments, chances, threats, etc., as well as make well-motivated design decisions that enable a move from the existing situation into the desired strategic direction.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        <h4>Tactical planning</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Use enterprise architecture to provide boundaries and identify plateaus (intermediary steps) for the transformation of the enterprise toward the articulated strategic direction. In this context, enterprise architecture is used as a planning tool, making the realization of a strategy more tangible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Use enterprise architecture to give a clear context and direction for a portfolio of projects working toward the realization of the first plateau as defined at the tactical planning level.

                    <p>
                        Use enterprise architecture as a means to select one or more standard solutions and/or packages that are to become part of the solution and/or decide to outsource an entire business process/service to another enterprise.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <header>
                        <h4>Solution architecture</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Use enterprise architecture to create the high level design of an actual step in the enterprise transformation as it will be realized (and implemented) in the context of a specific project.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In Fig. 3.7, we have illustrated these seven application areas. Each of these seven application areas will yield different enterprise architectures, which are clearly interdependent. By ensuring compliance among these architectures, governance, and informed decision-making, from the strategic level to the operational level is enabled.

                <h3>3.4 Defining Enterprise Architecture</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The previous sections will undoubtedly already have shed some light on what we regard as enterprise architecture. In this section, we will make this more specific by providing our own definition of this concept.
            </p>
            <section>
                <header>
                    <h4>3.4.1 Definitions of Enterprise Architecture</h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Before providing our definition of enterprise architecture, we start with a discussion of some of the existing definitions of IT/information/enterprise architecture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines architecture as: “An architecture is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution [60].”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Open Group’s Architectural Framework (TOGAF) defines architecture as: “Architecture has two meanings depending upon its contextual usage: (1) A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at component level to guide its implementation; (2) The structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time [139].”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Clinger–Cohen Act’s definition of IT architecture is: “The term “information technology architecture,” with respect to an executive agency, means an integrated framework for evolving or maintaining existing information technology and acquiring new information technology to achieve the agency’s strategic goals and information resources management goals [142].”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Netherlands Architecture Forum (NAF), defines architecture conceptually as “a normative restriction of design freedom” and operationally as “a set of design principles [154].” As a background to this definition, NAF writes: “In general, the design freedom of designers is undesirable large. The idea of architecture is to take advantage of this. Therefore, architecture is defined as normative restriction of design freedom. This idea of consciously applying normative restriction of design freedom is the really new thing. It makes architecture a prescriptive notion; any descriptive interpretation is cogently rejected.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ArchiMate Foundation defines enterprise architecture to be “A coherent whole of principles, methods, and models that are used in the design and realization of an enterprise’s organizational structure, business processes, information systems, and infrastructure [78].”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The current architecture definition of Capgemini is: “An architecture is a set of principles, rules, standards, and guidelines, expressing and visualizing a vision and implementing concepts, containing a mixture of style, engineering, and construction principles.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A recent definition from the Gartner Group is: “Enterprise architecture (EA) is the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and improving the key principles and models that describe the enterprise’s future state and enable its evolution.”
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The variety in these definitions does seem to indicate that the field of enterprise architecture is still in its infancy. At the same time, however, the wide spread attention of enterprise architecture does indicate that enterprises do feel a profound need to steer their development (including their business and IT portfolio), and that they are looking toward enterprise architecture as a means to fill this need.

                    <h4>3.4.2 Perspectives on the Role of Enterprise Architecture</h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    While the above definitions may seem to differ considerably, what all these definitions seem to have in common is a reference to structure and relationships combined with a reference to a set of governing principles that provide guidance and support for directions and decisions. Enterprise architecture focuses on shaping and governing the design of the future enterprise using principles to stipulate future direction and models to underpin and visualize future states. In our opinion, there are three important perspectives on the role of an enterprise architecture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A regulation-oriented perspective</strong> which manifests itself as a prescriptive notion governing the design of an enterprise. When taking this perspective, one will focus on principles, leading to rules, guidelines, and standards, focusing the enterprise’s design freedom in the direction of its success.

                    <li>
                        <strong>A design-oriented perspective</strong> which emphasises the comprehensive and cohesive specification of an enterprise in all its facets, as a high level design. This perspective focuses on essential design decisions, as well as its core structures. When taking this perspective, one typically produces models that describe the design of actual systemic artefacts and their interrelations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A patterns-oriented perspective</strong> which focuses on the use of design patterns. This perspective forms a bridge between the regulative and the design perspectives. To meet the regulations set out in the regulative perspective, during design activities, suitable patterns can be applied.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The regulation and design-oriented perspectives correspond to the earlier mentioned indicator and control aspects of the dashboard paradigm as depicted in Fig. 3.5, and are complementary to each other in that the regulation-oriented perspective accommodates for the need to steer and direct developments, while the second perspective supports the need to gain insight into an enterprise’s design while also providing guidance to designers of enterprise systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though not many definitions of architecture explicitly refer to the patternsoriented perspective, the role of patterns to capture and reuse design knowledge (such as the quality attributes that will result from using specific patterns) in the creation of architecture (be it for buildings, software, or enterprises) is evident [5, 15, 44, 123].

                    Using these perspectives, we can now define what we regard as enterprise architecture:

                <p>
                    <blockquote>

                </header>
                <p>
                    In practice, an enterprise architecture covers several foci that blend together to form the enterprise architecture. Without attempting to provide an exhaustive list, some typical (example) views are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a business view, one would define the integrated structure of the overall business itself (in terms of organization, people and processes, and resources). Business architecture supports business change with a more holistic perspective. This approach is becoming more important with the move toward service-oriented architecture at the business level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In an IT view, one would define and describe the structure and relationships of IT systems including the way IT supports the enterprise to achieve its business goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A governance view would address the full range of governance, from business governance (how to manage overall business processes, both formal and informal) to organizational and systems governance and also IT systems management capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A security view addresses the full range of security, from business and information security to IT security. It also addresses the required security for organizational and business-related services. It is often linked to governance aspects to address security management.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In Chap. 4, we will discuss several dimensions along which to identify additional views. In the next section, the concept of view will be defined as being one of the key concepts of enterprise architecture.

                <h3>3.5 Key Concept of Enterprise Architecture</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Enterprise architecture can help organizations and their transformation processes in successfully executing their strategy. As such, it acts as an active planning and steering instrument, which can be used in translating strategy to programs and projects, and revolves around four main components: principles, models, views, and frameworks. Organizational transformation processes, embodied in programs and projects, can use the principles, models and views as a means of content based steering in the coherence of the solution. In this section, we will explore the concepts of concerns, principles, models, views, and frameworks.

                </header>
                <p>
                    An enterprise has many stakeholders. Future development of an enterprise is likely to impact on the interests of these stakeholders. In this section, we briefly survey some classes of stakeholders and their specific concerns. In this book, we use the definition of stakeholder and concern as provided in [60]. A stakeholder is an individual, team, or organization (or classes thereof) with interest in, or concerns relative to, a system (such as an enterprise). Concerns are those interests, which pertain to the system’s development, its operation or any other aspect that is critical or otherwise important to one or more stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In making decisions about an enterprise’s future directions, stakeholders want to obtain insight into the impact these directions will have on their concerns, and understand the risks involved in current and future initiatives. Even more, since present day enterprises are complex social systems of interrelated processes, people and technology, stakeholders are keen on finding a way to harness this complexity when judging the impact on their concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As discussed before, each type of stakeholder has its specific need for insight, control, and overview. At the same time, they all want insight into the potential impact on the enterprise resulting from changes in its own strategy or its environment, and consequences of decisions about the enterprise’s future directions. They also have the desire to communicate about these changes and impact. Communication will take place at enterprise level, business unit level, department level, and project level depending on the responsibilities of the stakeholder involved in the communication. Below, we briefly zoom in on the interests and concerns of three typical classes of stakeholders, and their needs on enterprise architecture.

                    <h4>3.5.2 Principles</h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    An univocal understanding about what is of fundamental importance for the organization is essential. This is represented by the term “principle.” Even though no broadly accepted definition of principle exists yet, principles are generally regarded as constraints on the design space for enterprise engineers [98]. According to TOGAF [139], principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission. The extensible Architecture Framework (xAF) defines a principle as “a generic (functional or constructional) requirement for a class of systems [154],” where a class of systems is, e.g., all enterprise information systems, so not only for an individual system. According to Capgemini’s integrated architecture framework (IAF), a principle is a statement of belief, approach, or intent which directs the formulation of the architecture, and may refer to the current state or a desired future state [30, 45]. In this book, we will primarily follow the xAF definition as it provides an operational way of steering business and/or IT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to TOGAF, “a good set of principles will be founded in the beliefs and values of the organization and expressed in language that the business understands and uses. Principles should be few in number, future oriented, and endorsed, and championed by senior management. They provide a firm foundation for making architecture and planning decisions, framing policies, procedures, and standards, and supporting resolution of contradictory situations [139].” As discussed in [22], when considering the many different definitions of principles, three typical perspectives on principles can be discerned:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Principles as inherent laws</strong> referring to properties of (classes of) a system that can be observed and validated. Examples are the law of gravity, relativity theory, law of requisite variety, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Principles as imposed laws</strong> referring to properties of (classes of) a system that can be validated. Examples are: traffic laws, societal laws, policies and regulations within organizations, such as we opt for customer intimacy, we comply with privacy laws, and business flexibility has precedence over efficiency. Principles as imposed laws typically address the concerns of stakeholders. Some of these concerns may actually be triggered by an inherent law which might have a negative impact on the system/enterprise being engineered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Guidelines</strong> are properties of (classes of) a system that are specific enough to provide guidance to operational behavior to make it fit within the borders set out by imposed laws, possibly referring to the use of mechanisms. For example: “use your car’s cruise control” is an advisable guideline to abide by, in an effort to obeying imposed laws concerning maximum speeds on roads, using the in-built mechanism of the car’s cruise control.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In line with the definition of enterprise architecture used in this book, we will primarily use the last two perspectives on principles.

                    <h4>3.5.3 Models</h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    In general, models are a purposeful abstraction of reality. More specifically, a model is defined as “any subject using a system A that is neither directly nor indirectly interacting with a system B, to obtain information about the system B, is using A as a model for B [8].” In colloquial use in the context of enterprise engineering, the term model is equated to some graphical diagram. This colloquialism can be explained as most models used in software development, business process (re)engineering, etc., are graphical models. Models, however, do not necessarily have to be graphical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As depicted in Fig. 3.8, in general, three categories of systems can be distinguished: concrete systems, symbolic systems, and conceptual systems [35], also leading to three main classes of models. A concrete model of a concrete system is called an imitation (e.g., a scale model of a car). A conceptual model of a concrete system is called a conceptualization (e.g., a process model as the conceptualization of processes). A concrete model of a conceptual system is called an implementation (e.g., a process as the implementation of a process model). A conceptual model of a conceptual system is called a conversion (e.g., the algebraic concept of a circle (x squared plus y squared = r squared) is a conversion of the geometry of its concept). A symbolic model of a conceptual system is called a formulation, and is expressed in some formal language. A conceptual model of a symbolic system is called an interpretation and is the reverse of a formulation. A symbolic model of a symbolic system is called a transformation (e.g., the transformation from Morse code to Roman notation of letters).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In enterprise architecting, a multitude of graphical and nongraphical models are needed. The set of required models spans over multiple dimensions of focus, goals, and purpose. Some examples are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        differing levels of realization: from conceptual via logical to physical;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        differing aspects of transformation: from contextual (why) via design (where to) to the actual transformations (how);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        different aspects of a enterprises: from goals via services, products and processes to IT;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        differing levels of aggregation: from enterprise level to the level of specific (partial) processes or applications.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even more, models referring to one specific version/alternative of an enterprise, need to be coherent, also requiring coherence between models over the above dimensions. A core driver of the ArchiMate project [78] was also to increase the coherence between different aspects and models used in an enterprise architecture. In [78], several examples are shown which illustrate the need for coherence between different models used in an enterprise architecture.

                <p>
                    The complexity of the execution of an enterprise’s strategy is likely to be immense because many processes, departments, and information systems are involved. When using enterprise architecture as a planning and steering instrument, then this instrument should reflect this complexity (the law of requisite variety [15]). As a result, it is almost undoable to make one single univocal and comprehensive set of models that can be used for all people concerned, therefore, several views are needed which focus on specific stakeholders and their concerns [78]. In Sect. 4.3, we will discuss the most common types of stakeholders involved in an architecture project. Stakeholders are important and their cooperation is necessary for a successful project, because they are the providers of resources, most of them are influencers, some even decision-makers, and they have information about objectives and constraints. Therefore, the architectural descriptions should answer their concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different views based upon the stakeholders concerns are an important communication means to obtain the cooperation of the stakeholders. A view is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns [60]. This puts the notion of a view close to the notion of a model. We actually treat a model as being a special kind of view:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                         a model is a purposeful abstraction of reality that cannot be formally derived from another model without changing the way in which the model represents the domain;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a view is a purposeful abstraction of reality that is derived formally from one or more models without changing the way in which the model represents the domain.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Therefore, each model is a view, but not each view is a model. As a background to these definitions, we refer to [129]; Stachowiak distinguishes between three different “model features”:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The mapping feature, concerned with the fact that a model is based on an original (the modeled domain).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The reduction feature, which deals with the fact that a model reflects a relevant selection of an original’s properties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The pragmatic feature, which is concerned with the usability of the model as a placeholder for the original with respect to some purpose.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Creating a model means creating/adjusting the mapping feature of a specific model. In creating views, one makes changes to the reduction and pragmatic features, without changing the mapping feature. Changing the latter would lead to another model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The (example) dimensions for models as discussed above, apply to views as well. Even more, in the case of views one typically feels the urge to introduce views that are tuned to the interests and cognitive abilities of stakeholders as well as the communication goal at hand [107, 108].
                </p>
                <p>
                    To provide architects with some structure to select views, architecture frameworks have been introduced. These frameworks intend to aid architects by providing an ontology, which uses different abstraction levels to map all kinds of information needed. Architecture frameworks position architecture results and enable diverse communication (stakeholders, detail). Often tools and best practices are included in the framework to support the work needed.

                <h3>3.6 Benefits of Enterprise Architecture</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                In Sect. 3.3, we already discussed seven key applications for enterprise architecture: situation description, strategic direction, gap analysis, tactical planning, operational planning,selection of partial solutions, and solution architecture, enabling informed governance. We will now revisit the issue of the benefits of enterprise architecture as an instrument for informed governance, where we aim to make the benefits of enterprise architecture more explicit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though a thorough scientific evaluation of the benefits of enterprise architecture is still lacking, the case for enterprise architecture has indeed been made by several market watchers, practitioners, and business visionaries. Drawing on their study of numerous companies worldwide, [118] show how constructing the right enterprise architecture enhances profitability and time to market, while it improves strategy execution. A similar line of reasoning is expressed as “To keep the business from disintegrating, the concept of information systems architecture is becoming less of an option and more of a necessity for establishing some order and control in the investment of information system resources” in [155]. Nevertheless, an initial attempt for such evaluations has been reported in [121], though we still find objective figures lacking.

                <p>
                    It goes without saying that enterprise architecture is a means to an end. This justifiably raises the question of the benefit of enterprise architecture. We position it to be a tool or means to support strategy formulation, planning and strategy execution. In essence an enterprise architecture is a tool to manage complexity and risks. It enables informed decision-making, planning and governing of transformations. As a means it can be used:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        within strategic business/IT planning;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to align strategic objectives and IT;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to define and guide large scale business and/or IT transformation;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to structure organization reengineering;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to enable design of organizational networks (shared service centers, BPO, etc.);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to define and monitor IT programs.

                <p>
                    The IEEE working group on (software) architecture [60] mentions the following potential uses for architecture-models and associated descriptions:
                </p>
                <ul>

                <p>
                    Even though the IEEE working group was primarily working on software architecture, the above list of uses equally well applies to descriptions produced in the case of enterprise architecture (when replacing system by enterprise in the above texts).

                <p>
                    In [13], the Software Engineering Institute has identified the following potential uses for architectural descriptions, which can also be generalized to enterprise architecture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        it is a vehicle for communication among stakeholders;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it captures early design decisions, both functional aspects as well as quality aspects;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the global structure decided upon in the architecture, also structures further development;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it is a transferable abstraction of a system.

                    In terms of the uses as sketched above, and taking the dashboard perspective into account, enterprise architecture can deliver value to the business in many different ways. In an attempt to make this more concrete, the following are some examples of the values that can be realized through the use of architecture [30]. To demonstrate their impact effectively, they have been categorized as specific to business, IT, or both.

                    <h4>3.6.3 Added Value over Classical Approaches</h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    It is a fair question to ask what the added value is of an architectural approach in comparison to existing approaches in which an enterprise’s strategy is translated to a program of activities, which is consequently executed. Enterprise architecture is positioned (see Fig. 3.4) between strategy and transformation program. This immediately raises questions such as: What is new about this? Can’t one do without it? In Sect. 2.5, we already surveyed traditional approaches in meeting an enterprise’s challenge. Now that we have defined what enterprise architecture is, we can identify the added value over classical approaches:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By designing a coherent conceptualization of a solution first, one assures that programs to realize the solution are complementary to each other instead of overlapping or even incompatible;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It enables the management to more fundamentally and explicitly underpin their decisions about the sequence of projects;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It offers guidance and boundaries for the realization. When not applying architecture, each project will use the solution alternatives that are optimal for the project and possibly not the best for the coherent solution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As also illustrated in Fig. 3.4, enterprise architecture does not aim to replace the classic (mostly program management) approach, but rather aims to complement it. Program management and enterprise architecture need each other. Program management cares for effectiveness and the control of time and budget. Enterprise architecture focuses on steering toward coherent solutions, aligning projects with this coherent solution, as well as setting boundaries for and providing guidance to the implementation of complex systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever an enterprise is faced with a complex or messy problem [117] about its future organizational structure, IT support, etc., it is sensible to use architecture to gain better insight into the issues involved. By handling problems one by one, solution development becomes phased and manageable. The drawback is that solutions not necessarily match and fit together. In recent years, we have seen many examples of these mismatches in change portfolios. This yields surprises in systems management costs and users not being satisfied with their business and IT support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By applying architecture, we treat problems in coherence. Instead of jumping to solutions right away, we develop a solution concept that takes away a fair amount of the degrees of freedom one traditionally used to have, but caters for detailed decisions made during systems development, while maintaining consistency. This sparks of interoperability, economies of scale (through common use), and possibilities for standards. It enforces a more consistent overall experience of the systems.

                    <h4>3.6.4 Use it Wisely</h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    After discussing the potential added value in the previous subsection, one might wonder “is architecture the cure for every issue an enterprise has to deal with?” The simple answer is no. However, we will now add some nuance to this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do regard enterprise architecture as being a powerful means for management to obtain a holistic view of the enterprise and for facilitating decision-making and to set boundaries and provide guidance for implementation of complex systems. However, it is only a powerful means when it is applied properly and for the right reasons. So be aware when applying enterprise architecture that the chosen means does indeed fit the intended objectives. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Enterprise architecture typically provides management with an outlook on the coming 3 to 5 years. This outlook is rendered out of the many and various inputs the management provided themselves. Based on this outlook, management is able to plan programs for the realization of the chosen future direction. If an enterprise only aims to build a detached system with the intention to dispose of it, since it has no role of importance to play in the longer term strategy of the enterprise, one should not use enterprise architecture as a means to guide the realization of this temporary system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the same time, however, one needs to beware that these disposable, short-term solutions, do not actually become permanent or even worse, become critical for the execution of the business. When such a risk does exist, either an enterprise architecture should be used after all, or measures (governance!) should be taken to ensure that the disposable system is indeed disposed of.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enterprise architecture is used to provide insight and to reduce risks. If a system being designed is relatively simple and risk-free, applying enterprise architecture will not provide additional insights and is, therefore, overkill.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some additional (anonymized) examples of scenarios leading to potential failures in using enterprise architecture are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To use an enterprise architecture for a different means than it was developed for. As a typical example: suppose a specific enterprise architecture was developed to support the development of a business case. By nature, the business case will focus on feasibility of the proposed initiative and its cost/benefit. In this case, the enterprise architecture was designed as a high level solution and will help to find the major investment areas; as such it will not contain any guidelines for implementation. If the objective of this enterprise architecture is not clearly stated, an organization may be tempted to use this enterprise architecture to guide realization projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An enterprise architecture is used after its period of validity. In some cases, an enterprise architecture has been developed, but not put into use or not been maintained. If that same enterprise architecture is again used after some time, without checking whether it is still valid, the wrong decisions will be made.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An enterprise architecture has been designed for a regulatory use, but no measures have been implemented to monitor and control the adherence of projects to these regulations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A view on the enterprise architecture that was developed to communicate about the enterprise architecture to senior management, is taken to be the actual enterprise architecture (and not the underlying models).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any initiative—including quick wins or those to solve an immediate issue—can only be realized if they adhere to the enterprise architecture. In this case, the enterprise architecture, intended for strategic and long term initiatives, is wrongly used to restrict and complicate short term projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Key decisions were made individually instead of in shared agreement with all relevant stakeholders, resulting in suboptimal and possibly overlapping solutions. Examples of this can easily be found in situations of decentralized governance, where for the same problem several solutions exist in several organizational units or (geographically defined) regions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only a part of the architectural engagement was carried out. If, for instance, an aspect such as security is forgotten, it might lead to a coherent, but unsafe solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One looks only from a limited perspective at the system being designed (not holistic). This might work well if it is by chance the most relevant perspective. Examples of this can be found where the IT department decides to implement new technology that does not effectively facilitate the business processes, most likely resulting in additional work in the business process as well as day-to-day irritations of the users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enterprise architecture facilitates decision-making processes by providing a holistic view of the enterprise, leading to better-informed decision-making. At the same time, though, this is likely to make the decision-making process harder. This provides a challenge for the use of effective viewpoints providing decision makers with effective insight into all (and precisely all) relevant aspects affected by the decision to be made. When not using these mechanisms wisely, however, the result might be more confusion rather than more insight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Architecture is a means, and should not become a goal itself. One should only design the architecture at such level needed for the necessary insight and then stop. Nevertheless, numerous projects show that this risk is quite real!

                <h3>3.7 Competencies of an Enterprise Architect</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Even though Chap. 6 we provides a more detailed discussion of the skills required by architects and the challenges facing them, the discussions in this chapter already do allow us to briefly reflect on these competencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, for a proper execution of a strategy, an additional means in addition to vision, strategy and program management is needed: enterprise architecture. The means should be an unambiguous and understandable instrument supporting stakeholders in their joint decision making, setting the direction and guiding the execution. Enterprise architecture should indeed reflect the shared conceptualization of all stakeholders at a sufficiently specific level.

                The enterprise architect will face the challenge of creating and applying such an instrument in a qualitative manner. For instance, his architectural description should answer the concerns of the stakeholders. To what extent, is it complete with respect to stakeholders, concerns, and answers and to what extent is completeness feasible? In short: when is the architecture good enough from the perspective of product and process? Such an instrument should have a continuous value in steering the enterprise. Therefore, enterprise architecture needs to be embedded in the overall change and governance processes of the enterprise, as is the case in portfolio and program management. And it should be adapted to changes in the technology and business environment and concerns of stakeholders.

                There is not one way of creating an enterprise architecture. Each specific situation has its own stakeholders, complexity, subject matter, and scale. The current state of the craft is that many methods, tools, and frameworks exist, both for products and processes. The quality of the enterprise architect determines the proper selection, adaptation and use of those in the specific situation. The current body of knowledge mainly exists of unrelated best practices in methods and frameworks. Current scientific developments work toward streamlining and finding common ground under successful best practices. We see enterprise architecture emerging as a new and exciting trans-discipline.

            <p>
                In this chapter, we started out with historical account of the term “architecture” and how its found its way from construction via computer hardware to software, and finally to the design of enterprises. To more theoretically underpin the role of enterprise architecture as an instrument for governance, we continued with a discussion of the governance paradigm. We proposed to regard enterprise architecting as a process involving a dashboard giving stakeholders indicators and controls allowing the gain insight into the current state of enterprise, alternatives for the future, as well as the performance of the transformation process(es), and to steer/direct these transformations. As a next step, we discussed seven key applications for enterprise architecture: situation description, strategic direction, gap analysis, tactical planning, operational planning, selection of partial solutions, and solution architecture, enabling informed governance.

            <p>
                We then went on to discuss several definitions of architectures, finally leading to an understanding of how enterprise architecture is regarded in this book. In our definition of enterprise architecture, we regard it as being combination of a regulationoriented, design-oriented and a patterns-oriented perspective, where the designoriented perspective is mainly pivoted toward the indicators on the dashboard and the design-oriented perspective toward the controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then turned our focus to the key concepts of enterprise architecture: stakeholders, concerns, principles, models, views, and frameworks. Using the discussion of the key concepts as a background, we then revisited the potential benefits of enterprise architecture, and the potential value of architectural descriptions. We also stressed the fact that enterprise architecture is not the right answer to all situations. When applied in the wrong situation, serious negative consequences may result. We finished this chapter with a first exploration of the challenges that should be met by enterprise architects.

            </header>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Enterprise architecture is answering the needs that business administration and organizational design should address! Even more, we should add this knowledge to the body of knowledge for business administration and organizational design.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enterprise architecture should restrain itself to the regulation-oriented perspective; all other work is simply high-level design. There is no need for yet another concept.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enterprise architecture is an enjoyable intellectual exercise. However, in the end, senior management will take their decisions mainly based on their business feeling and intuition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Full business/IT alignment can not be reached without the use of enterprise architecture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The instruments of the enterprise architecture (principles, models, views, frameworks) are far less important than the process involved-in/concerning enterprise architecture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The creation and use of an enterprise architecture takes too long and, therefore, falls in exactly the same pitfall as “endless strategy formulation.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    A project which aims to realize a part of an enterprise architecture does not need an enterprise architect. The enterprise architecture itself provides all the guidance needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Architecture principles are useless since they are not specific enough. A real design is much more useful as it makes the final result much more tangible.
